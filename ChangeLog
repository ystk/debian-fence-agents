2017-01-06  Olaf Faaland  <faaland1@llnl.gov>

	fence_powerman: fix typo in option powerman-path
	References to dictionary options[] sometimes used key "powerman_path"
	and other times "powerman-path", resulting in references to keys that
	did not exist.

	This resulted in total failure of the fence agent.

	This commit makes the key used consistent.

	fencing: Specify command to be logged by run_command
	Currently run_command special cases the logging of commands with ipmitool and removes everything
	between the flat -P and -p. Instead of special casing commands with ipmitool allow the caller to
	provide the command to log so that the command can do any necessary scrubbing of the message to be

	build: fix possibly undefined macro AC_PYTHON_MODULE
	As already mentioned 2 years back by Alan Evangelista[1], fence-agents
	project indeed uses a strange build setup, which furthermore makes it
	impossible to pass the configure stage successfully, at least with
	some combinations of the "autotools" programs' versions (e.g., as old
	ones as present in RHEL 6).

	Remedy is as simple as originally suggested, which also means m4
	directory no longer needs to be reinsured in autogen.sh (though it
	still is as a legacy), but special care must be taken with .gitignore
	and maintainer-clean-local target of the main Makafile.

	* Set default for powerman_path in configure

	fence_action() automatically queries power status after a power_set
	function call, because many devices report success when the on/off
	actually failed.

	* Delay before checking powerman is executable
	Use the provided run_delay() function to determine when a delay is
	necessary.  Call it before testing that the powerman binary is
	executable.  The project's sanity tests depend on this to handle the
	missing dependency (powerman), within their testing environment.

	1.1) Status
	$ fence_ironic -k $OS_AUTH_URL -l admin -p $OS_PASSWORD -o status -n 2b40a642-3d7b-4a43-b6a2-57a3967ebb1c
	Status: ON

	1.2) Power off

	Success: Powered ON

	1.4) Power on (when already powered on)
	fence_ironic -k $OS_AUTH_URL -l admin -p $OS_PASSWORD -o on -n 2b40a642-3d7b-4a43-b6a2-57a3967ebb1c
	Success: Already ON

	2) With ironic services down/in error

	Failed: Unable to obtain correct plug status or plug is not available

	2.2) Power off
	$ fence_ironic -k $OS_AUTH_URL -l admin -p $OS_PASSWORD -o off -n 2b40a642-3d7b-4a43-b6a2-57a3967ebb1c
	Failed: Unable to obtain correct plug status or plug is not available

	2.3) Power on
	$ fence_ironic -k $OS_AUTH_URL -l admin -p $OS_PASSWORD -o on -n 2b40a642-3d7b-4a43-b6a2-57a3967ebb1c

	Allow to select which instances to evacuate
	In order to select which instances could be evacuated automatically,
	the instance has to have either:
	 - a flavor where one extra spec key is "evacuate" with "True" as value
	 - an image where a metadata key is "evacuate" with "True" as value

	In case one instance is neither having a flavor or an image like that,
	the instance won't be evacuated.

	fence_scsi: Offer hard-reboot option for fence_scsi_check script
	The existing implementation of fence_scsi_check returns an error if any
	device is no longer registered properly, and this error return causes
	watchdog to use its custom procedure to reboot the host.  This procedure
	is prone to blocking, especially when GFS2 file systems are mounted or
	multipath devices are configured to queue indefinitely, so having the
	check be able to hard-reboot the host instead of returning a failure
	gives a means for avoiding these blockages.

	fence_scsi: Status report "off" if any device is off during "on" action
	We need status to report "on" if any device is on most of the time so
	that stonith or other entities can know if a host is capable of
	accessing shared resources, but during an "on" action this is
	problematic because even if some devices are off, we will skip turning
	them on since we reported the status as on.  This changes the behavior
	to report "off" if any device is off, but only during "on" actions.

	fencing: Propagate 'list' only when it makes sense

	fencing: Operation 'validate-all' should not change default behaviour
	Previously included patch has issue for fence agents that have 'other_conditions=True'. In such

	used.

	fencing: Add alias 'meta-data' as proposed in OCF standard
	Actions 'meta-data' is just an alias to 'metadata'.

	fencing: Add operation 'validate-all'
	Previously, user had to run fence agent in non-destructive mode to find out
	if parameters are correct or not. With this commit, the action 'validate-all'
	(required by OCF) is added and parameters that can be checked without connecting
	to real hardware are tested.

	As a bonus of this approach, if there are several problems, user will know all
	of them at once what is a benefit also for user interfaces.

	fence_kdump: Fix possible problems according to Coverity

	fencing: default value for ipport was not always correct

	[refactor] simplifying function metadata() + fix XML for fence_cisco_ucs
	Two if-s where removed as they are no longer needed by fence agents. One of
	its impact was that two fence agents has changed their XML metadata. In case
	of fence_ovh it was because default value was set even when it should not be.
	And in the case of cisco_ucs, default was not propagated properly because
	it was empty string.

2014-12-03  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	[refactor] Change definition of log_expect() method
	Previously, log_expect definition was:
	    def log_expect(self, options, pattern, timeout):

	but the 'options' where not used anywhere and if we will plan to use it in this method,
	we already have self.opt available. New method definition is:
	    def log_expect(self, pattern, timeout):

	the rest of this large patch is just removing of options as 1st argument of every call

	fence_bladecenter: Simplify login process
	Previously, unique regular expression was used what could cause problems in
	planned autodetection of fence agents.

	fence_cisco_ucs: protocol prefix of URL was not correctly set with --ssl-(in)secure
	Resolves: rhbz#1165591

	fencing: Fix problem with not validating SSL certificates
	In commit 809b909651118c06d2ab48d7911bbee2e512e478, --ssl-(in)secure options were
	added. With --ssl be equal to --ssl-secure this was not implemented properly.

	Resolves: rhbz#1162092

	fence_mpath: new fence agent for dm-multipath based on mpathpersist
	Previously, scenario with multipath and underlying SCSI devices was solved by using
	fence_scsi what works correctly but there are some limitation. The most important
	is that unfencing has to be done when all paths are available as it is executed only once.
	This new fence agent solve this situation properly as most of this situations are solved
	by mpathpersist which is part of dm-multipath.

2014-11-13  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fence_scsi: "order" value of *_path should be same as in library

	fencing: Introduce --gnutlscli-path --sudo-path --ssh-path and --telnet-path
	Previously, those four variables were set as global options. Proposed change
	unify the working with them as with standard options with appropriate default
	value (provided by autoconf).

	This patch is quite long because XML metadata has to be changed to contain those
	options were appropriate.

	fencing: Improve accessibility of possible connection (+telnet,+web)
	'web' was previously not set properly on each fence agent
	'telnet' is completely new option

	fencing: Some short options were not propagated, so they were removed
	In old versions, it was required to have short getopt options (-k, -x, ...) for
	each option available. This is not true for some time but these options
	were defined also for options were they were not really used and long options were
	the only presented.

	Main reason for removing this short options from specific options was that some
	of them were really overloaded.

	fence_scsi: Short getopt for logfile differs in help/getopt
	According to help text, user should use -a for setting logfile but
	this option means 'APTL flag", this patch fixes it to -f as was accepted
	also before.

	fencing: Stability of sort of items in XML metadata
	Previously, sorting was done only according to values in "order" but
	if several items have same "order" value then they were sorted same way
	only until something did not interfere it. In order to have XML metadata
	more stable, the secondary attribute for sorting - stdin name of attribute.

	Problem was visible only during regression testing of XML metadata as ordering
	did not usually impact applications that reuse it.

	The patch is long but the only real change is in lib/fencing.py.py, the
	rest is just reordering without further changes.

2014-10-23  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fencing: Available actions in --help where not always up-to-date
	Previously, we have different help text for action only for fabric fencing (no-reboot). But
	we have fence agents that do not have 'status' action e.g. fence_ovh. With this update,
	the help text is always accurate.

	When auth type has a default value set to 'none' then autodetect of auth type is not
	done. If user want to user password, he had to enter -A password, with this patch this is
	not necessary (as in previous C-based implementation)

	fence_ipmilan: Improve readibility of verbose output

	fencing: Error messages should be send to STDERR by default
	Previously, it was sent to STDERR only when debug file was not set and --verbose was not set.

	Port of fence_ipmilan to fencing library.

	fencing: add function is_executale
	New function is_executable added to fencing library.
	Function checks if path is reachable and executable.
	Used for example in fence_amt to check path to amttool.

	fence_apc_snmp: Add Tripplite PDU support
	Tested with Tripplite PDUMH20HVNET 12.04.0055 - SNMP v1, v2c, v3

2014-01-06  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fencing: Do not use public keys when identity-file is not defined
	Previously, fence agent (ssh) tried to use keys before it asks for password. This lead to a situation
	when fence agent did not work correctly as it was waiting for 'Password' which did not occur.

2013-12-19  Ondrej Mular  <omular@redhat.com>

	fencing: new option --method
	Add new option method --method for cycle reboot

2013-12-16  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fence_virsh: Add UUID support for fence_virsh
	UUID support for fence_virsh (libvirt) was added. The only function which has to be rewritted was
	get_power_status as currently, there is no easy way how to print (name, uuid and state) via virsh.

	This patch is based on one proposed by Bogdan Dobrelya for RHEL6.

2013-12-02  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fencing: Add support for ipmitool/amttool binaries during autoconf
	Configuration of autoconf was extended to dynamically find ipmitool/amttool. If the binary is not found on
	the system then we will switch to default values (Fedora/RHEL). Path to binaries is exported and replaced in
	fencebuild using same processes as a version number or sbin/logdir.

2013-11-20  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fencing: Add information about option that have to be selected from list to XML metadata

	fencing: Add support for options which should be selected from a list of values
	Previously, we have supported only strings and booleans; this is first patch that adds
	support for entering constrains like select a proper SNMP version from [1, 2c, 3].

2013-11-12  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fence_drac5: Remove debug info

	fence_drac5: Add support for Dell DRAC MC model

	fencing: Issue with login when autodetection of EOL is used
	When fence agent attempts to login to fence device it tries to find out proper EOL. During tests
	on the new fence device (Dell DRAC MC) we have found two minor problems which are fixed in this commit:

	1) Regular expression for expected login prompt was case sensitive previously

	2) Expectation that after pressing ENTER we will obtain sequence:
	  login prompt, password prompt, login prompt, password prompt, ...
	was found to be incorrect as this fence device shows password prompt only when login prompt was not empty

2013-10-30  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	[build] updates in build system to properly work with metadata.rng
	Minor updates were required to build a package without this patch you
	can do ./autogen.sh; ./configure; make - but not a build package process

	fence_wti: Add support for named groups
	On some WTI devices it is possible to name a group of devices by single names (e.g. 1,2 -> server). These
	groups can be used to operate all these plugs by single command.

	Patch by: Thibat Pouzet

	fence_xenapy: Fix invalid use of options
	Fixing typos (--passwd -> --password; --uid --> --uuid)

	fence_vmware: Option --vmware_type is not used correctly
	--vmware_type is defined but --vmware-type was used in source code.

	fence_drac5: Fix test used for Dell DRAC CMC
	In version 4.x the '--module-name' was renamed to standard '--plug'. This patch
	reflects it.

	testing: Check if fence agent uses only valid keys in options["--???"]
	Valid keys are defined in fencing library or fence agent itself. This check
	will be run at every build, so we should be protected against case when
	developer unintentionally use new key (e.g. typo). These type of bugs are
	usually not detected by static analyzers.

	fence_vmware_soap: Correct error message when user does not have privileges
	Previously, when an user does not have privileges to reboot a virtual machine, the
	fence agent fails with python traceback. After applying this patch (by Shane Bradley),
	the fence_vmware_soap fails with human readable error message.

	Resolves: rhbz#1918263

	Add a metadata schema which reflects current state. In order to simplify it
	few minor changes were done to fence agents.

2013-10-07  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fence_zvm: Clean-up after replacing fence agent

	fence_vmware_soap, fence_ovh: Caching problem with SOAP library
	Both fence agents are built on top of SUDS library which creates a cache file. Unfortunately,
	it is not yet possible to completely move cache or remove it. Due to possible security issue (symlink
	vulnerability) we have decided to solve this problem as simply as possible. So '/tmp' was changed to an
	automatically generated temp directory which is removed at the exit of fence agent as we won't reuse it anyway.

	Resolves: rhbz#1014000

	fence_zvm: completely rewrited zvm fence agent
	Fence agent no longer requires package with s3270.

	fence_apc: Problem with <ENTER> prompt
	After introducing support for firmware 5.x, the length of command prompt regular expressions is not strictly equal to one.
	This patches solves this problem by moving '<ENTER>' prompt to first position (index 0), so we do not rely on length of
	command prompt.

2013-06-07  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fence_dummy: An option to add random delay to start of this fence agents
	Previously -R was used but this should be used for password script for SNMP, now -r is used.
	Functionality was added only now.

	fencing: Improve work with invalid power states
	Previously, status for N ports was OFF if all of these nodes where off
	and it differs when of these ports were ON. This did not work properly
	when fence agents responeded with 'unknown' values. This patches fixes
	this issue and if at least one value is non-OFF then status is not-OFF too.

	fencing: Actions to set power status are not working properly for fence agents without --plug
	The bug was introduced when support for multiple ports was added.
	    commit 0097e806545d722270b739f31a754d65994b18c9

	fence2rng.xsl: parametrize and make more flexible
	The output is 1:1 to the previous version, but it is now easy to change

	testing: Add test for multiple ports feature

2013-02-25  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fencing: Support multiple plugs for actions (e.g. --n 2,3,4)
	Previously, if you have a machine with two (or more) power lines you had to
	create a configuration in cluster.conf which was quite common a place for
	errors. Instead of pure "reboot" you had to use:
	1) port 1 off
	2) port 2 off
	3) port 1 on
	4) port 2 on

	With this patch you can use 'port 1,2 reboot'.

	New major version of firmware is now supported.

	Resolves: rhbz#886614

	testing: Add verbose mode to testing library

	testing: Add test suite for fence_drac on Dell DRAC IV

	COMPATIBILITY BREAK: remove support for Dell DRAC III and older
	Support for older DRAC devices was removed and fence agent was ported to fencing
	library. fence_drac should be now used only for Dell DRAC IV.

	fence agents: Fence agents errors are logged to syslog

2013-02-07  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fencing: Testing tool and dummy fence agent
	New testing tool for repeating sequences of action on given devices is ready. It should
	improve testing process of fence agents and simplify it. So more volunteers can test their
	devices.

	New fence agent "dummy" is used for testing fencing library as it does not require
	any hardware/software.

	fence_virsh: Replace constant (1) with variable from --power-wait

2013-02-04  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fence agents: Text in help is changed from foo=<value> to foo=[value]
	Unlike previous patch, this focus on fixing specif fence agents.

	fencing: Text in help is changed from foo=<value> to foo=[value]

	COMPATIBILITY BREAK: remove -q / quiet
	This option was never widely used because fence agents are quite quiet by default.

	COMPATIBILITY BREAK: replace udpport with ipport, make ipport dependent on ipaddress

	COMPATIBILITY BREAK: Remove obsolete options from STDIN
	For historical reasons and backward compatibility we supported these options
	blade -> port
	option -> action
	fm -> port
	hostname -> ipaddr

	These options were not in documentation and are completely removed now.

	COMPATIBILITY BREAK: fence_rsb replace -n / telnet_port with standard --ipport / ipport
	telnet_port has same functionality as ipport and -n is usually used for port number/UUID

	COMPATIBILITY BREAK: fence_lpar replace --n / --partition / partition with standard -n / --plug / port

	COMPATIBILITY BREAK: fence_drac5 replace --m / --modulename / modulename / module_name with standard -n / --plug / port
	This change apply to you only if you use fence agent against DRAC CMC, other DRACs are bound to one machine, so they
	do not use this option at all. Device option no_port (no port is needed) was added, previously modulename was optional
	and this is not true with 'port' option by default.

	COMPATIBILITY BREAK: remove option -T / --test / test
	Option -T was not used in all fence agents and its functionality differs. If you want to know if
	your fence device is working correctly use '-o monitor / --action monitor / STDIN: action=monitor'.

2013-01-29  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fence_drac5: Fix 'list' operation
	Device option 'separator' is set automatically when 'port' occurs but currently drac5 do not
	use 'port / -n' but 'module_name / -m'.

	fence_drac5: Fix regression on Dell CMC and Dell DRAC5
	Standard EOL for agents connecting via ssh is CR/LF.
	Some Dell devices represents CR/LF as double-enter what creates a problem in parsing of output.

	This patch adds a check for double-enter. This can be detected in function which power on/off machine
	because 'get power status' was run before and if we can find a line without any command we know that
	there is a double-enter problem.

2012-11-25  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fence_lpar: Option 'partion' is moved to fence_lpar
	This option was not part of patch a60ed3ca6fa0f63dfb09b46d99c2a281e2eed63e because it will be replaced
	by standard --port / plug option

	fencing: Do not check IP address if fence agent does not need any.

	fencing: Fix usage of UUID if option --port/plug is not defined.

	fencing: Move options which are used only once to appropriate fence agent
	@note: Fence agents which are going to removed/replaced were not fixed

	fencing: Add new option --ssh-options
	All fence agents which supports ssh connection can use
	--ssh-options / ssh_options to change default ssh parameters
	(different cipher, config file, ...)

2012-11-24  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fencing: Fix minor inconsistencies
	* integer instead of string
	* missing long options for option (--partition)

	fence_ilo_mp: Remove dependant device options like in rest of fence agents

	fencing: Improve XML metadata output
	Problem occurs when special characters are part of default values.

	fence_cisco_ucs: Simplify code by using rstrip()

	fence_lpar: Typo in definition of 'managed' option

	fencing: Operation 'reboot' is not working because fence_fabric was wrongly used
	Bug was introduced when doing change to fabric_fencing and list of available actions.

	fencing: Replace all short (getopt) options in code by their long variants
	Short (getopt) arguments are supported as before but all internal structures now
	should use their long variants. This makes code more readable and we should more
	easilly avoid problems when overloading short getopt on command line (e.g. -d).

2012-11-13  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fencing: Replace common options with more flexible mechanism
	Before this patch we had an option do add set of device options to all fence agents.
	e.g. device needs password, device needs ip address, ...

	This patch makes it more flexible as we can in addition do also options which depend on parent.
	e.g. if device needs password, then password script can be also used
	e.g. if device needs IP address, we can force it to use either IPv4 or IPv6

	fencing: UUID can be entered also as port number (-n / --plug / port)
	UUID is automatically detected using uuid library and we do not need
	a special option/argument for it anymore. (--uuid is still supported)

2012-11-08  Ryan O'Hara  <rohara@redhat.com>

	fence_scsi: change on_target metadata attribute
	This patch simply changes the on_target metadata attribute to use

	fence_hds_cb: Style clean-up

2012-11-08  Matt Clark  <mattjclark0407@hotmail.com>

	Fixed date of copyright. Copy paste error.

	New fencing script for Hitachi compute blade 2000
	This script uses the system console functionality of the Hitachi compute
	blade 2000 systems to fence a node. Status, list, on, off and reboot
	have all been implemented. Can use SSH or telnet as provided by the
	underlying fencing.py library.

2012-11-08  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fence agents: Transfer SNMP fence agents to long-opts + transfer script

	fencing: Simplify exceptions catching when closing connection
	When we are closing connection we do not care about exceptions. For example
	if action 'exit' failed, fencing is succesful anyway because our goal was to fence machine.

	fence agents: Transfer non-SNMP fence agents to long-opts

	fencing: Add support for usage of longopt keys in options
	This way we can make code more readable options["--power-timeout"] instead options["-g"].
	This code was created manually to support both short and long options but fence agents will
	be moved to long-options automatically.

2012-11-07  David Vossel  <dvossel@redhat.com>

	fence_scsi: support unfence action in Pacemaker

	fence agents: Exceptions (EOF/TIMEOUT) should be handled in fencing library, not in every fence agent
	Basic exception which can happends during get/set/list should be handled in fencing library and not in
	every fence agent. This patch simplify code of fencing agents which uses pexpect and pycurl.

	code cleanup: Fix warnings according to pylint and typos
	* remove unused 'global'
	* typos
	* start with renaming global variables from foo to FOO (python convention)

2012-10-29  Marek 'marx' Grac  <mgrac@redhat.com>

	fabric fence agents: Fix dealing with enable/disable and support on/off options for fabric fence agents

	fence-agents: Use default values for device options instead of per-agent solutions
	    Majority of these changes concern:
	    * (-x / ssh) to be turn on by default
	    * command prompt default which differs across fence agents

	fence_cisco_ucs: Incorrect timeout was used during login
	Previously, login command was bound with shell_timeout instead of login_timeout.

	fence-agents: Extend set of default device options
	There are device options which are common for every fence agent. This feature was introduced before
	but only new features were added. This patch removes common features from individual fence agents and
	adds it to the common set in fencing library.

	fence_vmware_soap: Faster fencing, fix crash on VM without valid UUID
	Improve speed of fencing by removing requests for attributes that are not needed. This change is significant
	when there are hundrens of VM on vSphere server. On the systems with <10 VM improvement is still about 20%.

	This patch also fixes situation when there are VM which do not have valid UUID. This can happend when P2V (physical
	to virtual machine process) failed.

	Patch was proposed by: Rodrigo A B Freire

	fence agents: autodetect of EOL in fence agents
	Fence agents diffes in EOL they accept. EOL \r\n is quite universal but in some cases
	it is translated to \n\n what makes login process impossible to complete as it ends like
	(capitals are fence agent response)

	Login: USER\n
	Password: \n

	Login: PASSWORD\n

	Until now there was a device option that handles that login_eol_lf but we found out that there are few
	APC devices which does not work correctly with \r\n and needs \n. So we have to autodetect it, this feature was
	added to standard library. As it can also helps with common problem when you have to write exactly
	conn.send("message" + "\r\n"). Method conn.sendline("") uses EOL according to platform, so we have decided to create
	new method conn.send_eol("message") which uses correct EOL. We need conn.sendline in communication with other local
	application so we should not reuse it for this purpose.

	Resolves: rhbz#740484

2011-09-19  Ryan O'Hara  <rohara@redhat.com>

	fence_scsi: fix simultaneous unfence operations
	This patch fixes an issue where multiple nodes attempt to unfence at
	the same time and fail when attempting to create a reservation. Each
	node checks to see if a reservation exists, and if not, it will attempt
	to create one. The problem occurs when multiple nodes see that no
	reservation exists and attempt to create one.

	This patch checks the return code of do_reserve. If this call fails,
	check again to see if a reservation was created by another node, in
	which case there is no error.

	After more testing, the time between when the fence_kdump agent begins

	ipmilan: Allow privilege selection
	In some cases, it's desirable to limit the rights to an iLO
	user in order to mitigate the fact that the login information
	is stored as plaintext in the cluster configuration.

	Unfortunately, ipmitool and fence_ipmilan do not work in this
	configuration.

	   # /usr/bin/ipmitool -I lanplus -H '10.1.9.40' \
	     -U 'fence' -P 'fencepost' -v chassis power status
	   RAKP 2 message indicates an error : unauthorized role requested
	   Error: Unable to establish IPMI v2 / RMCP+ session
	   Unable to get Chassis Power Status

	It turns out that dialing back the permissions on a user in iLO
	changes its privilege level, in this case from administrator to
	operator.  ipmitool defaults to administrator if nothing is
	specified, hence the error.  If the correct privilege level is
	given to ipmitool the command works:

	   # /usr/bin/ipmitool -I lanplus -H '10.1.9.40' \
	     -U 'fence' -L 'OPERATOR' -P 'fencepost' -v chassis power status
	   Chassis Power is on

	This patch adds the 'privlvl' option to fence_ipmilan, allowing
	administrators to change the privilege level in the cluster
	configuration.

	fence_scsi: grep for keys should be case insensitive
	When checking that a key is or is not registered for a device, the key
	comparison should be case insensitive. Using sg_persist to query for

2011-03-15  Jim Ramsay  <jim_ramsay@dell.com>

	Allow fence_scsi to use any valid hexadecimal key
	The check for a non-zero key is using perl's implicit string-to-integer
	conversion that only works on base 10 digits, which means that any key
	starting with at least one digit [1-9] will come through as okay, but
	any key starting with [A-F] will evaluate as 0 and fail the test.

	An explicit conversion to integer via hex() is the solution.

	I hit this in a cluster with a cluster ID of 43316 == 0xA934 and scsi
	fencing configured, where starting the cman service would always fail at
	the "Unfencing self" step.

	Before writing to fence_scsi.key or fence_scsi.dev, check to see if

	When unfencing occurs (action=on), write list of devices that were
	successfully registered to /var/run/cluster/fence_scsi.dev file. This
	file will be used by the optional watchdog script. Note that the devices
	are not added to the tmp file until the verification step.

	fence_scsi: move key file to /var/run/cluster
	Since the contents of /var/run/cluster/ directory are cleared on each

	fence_scsi: properly log errors for all commands
	There are a number of places in fence_scsi that call sg_persist commands

	improved by replacing the die call with log_error, such that any errors

	fence_scsi: verify that on/off actions succeed
	This patch adds code to verify that both "on" and "off" actions are
	successful. This is needed because there seem to be some arrays that
	do not report an error even when no registration was created, etc.

	These verification steps takes places after the action has been
	performed successfully. If an error was encountered while performing
	either an "on" or "off" action, fence_scsi will exit and no verification
	will take place. Failure to verify that an action was successful for any
	device will result is failure.

	For the "on" action, do_verify_on will check that the key was
	successfully registered with each devices and that a reservation exists
	on each device.

	For the "off" action, do_verify_off will check that the key was removed
	from each device and that a reservation exists on each device.

	fence_scsi: always do sg_turs for dm-mp devices
	This patch fixes a with the original patch posted last week. Before
	attempting to register with a device, we should call sg_turs on the
	device. If that device is a dm-multipath device, we should call sg_turs
	on all the paths. This can be done by simply moving the call to do_reset
	to do_register and do_register_ignore.

	Also, the patch adds a call to do_reset before doing a "status" action.
	If a node has been fenced and then proceeds to check its status, it will
	be in "unit attention" state.

	Resolves: rhbz#640343

	Reviewed-by: Lon Hohberger <lhh@redhat.com>

	fence_scsi: always do sg_turs before registration
	If a node has been fenced, or its key has been forcibly removed from
	device(s) by another node, the victim will see "unit attention" from the
	devices if/when it attempts to re-register. This error is normally
	reported just once, but will cause registration to fail. We can safely
	avoid this by calling sg_turs prior to each attempt to register with a
	device.

	fence_scsi: fix regular expression for grep
	When fence_scsi checks to see if a specific keys is registered for a
	specific device, it uses grep to look through a list of all registered
	keys. The existing regular expression was not specific enough, and could
	result in false positives. This patch fixes the problem by using anchors
	to make the regular expression more specific.

	fence_scsi: identify dm-multipath devices correctly
	Previously, fence_scsi would only identify /dev/dm* devices as being
	multipath devices. This prevented the use of "friendly" dm-multipath
	names (eg. /dev/mapper/mpath1). Since fence_scsi can now be passed
	devices to operate on, it should be able to handle "friendly" names,
	too. This patch fixes the problem by getting the absolute path of the
	device at registration time.

	fence_xvm has long dropped libxen in favour of libvirt that's been
	ported and build on all architecture and it's part of all distribution.

	Drop the special casing in the build system.

	fence agents: Option for setting port for telnet/ssh/ssl used by fence agent
	On some fencing devices there is possibility to change default port where
	ssh/ssl/telnet/... is listening. There is new option 'ipport' (getopt: -u)
	which can be used for this purpose. It is probable that it will make option
	'udpport' (also -u; currently used in SNMP based agents) obsoleted in one
	of the next versions.

	The lssyscfg command issued to the HMC by fence_lpar to get the status of the

	fence: Make SNMP v3 default for fence_intelmodular
	Since Intel Modular firmware update version 2.7, SNMP v2 write

	fence: Add support for IPv4/IPv6 forcing
	Support is added for agents written in Python, which
	uses standard fencing library and connecting
	by SNMP/nss_wrapper or SSH.

	Sadly telnet distributed with Fedora/RHEL doesn't
	has support for forcing IPv4/IPv6 connection, so
	it's impossible to implement this feature for agents
	using it.

	fence_nss_wrapper: Fix minor polling bug and force wrapper to build

	Fence_nss_wrapper is drop-on replacement of telnet_ssl.
	This is hobbit like tool with support for NSS (SSL)

	In contrast of old tool, this has many advantages:
	- Support for IPv6 (user can force IPv4)
	- Use polling instead of active waiting (non-blocking

	- Support for service names (not used in agents)

	have to be set because v3 and v4 are not compatibile. It is possible to auto-detect
	version (lshmc -V) but this is quite slow to do it in each fencing operation. Default
	value is '4' because we don't want to change previous behaviour. It does not mean
	that it should not work with HMC v5, v6 - we just need to mark them.

	Command prompt option was set to default value but missing in device's options. Older
	LPAR has different prompt so it was added to default one. If you wish to add your own
	prompt that remember that $ has to be written as '\$'.

	Make gfs2_freedi delete indirect blocks with height >= 2
	bz 474707 - GFS2: gfs2_convert not freeing blocks when removing file with height >=2

	Before this patch, the libgfs2 function gfs2_freedi would only
	free indirect blocks from an inode at height==1.  If an inode
	grew to a height of 2 or more, some blocks would not be freed
	when they should have been.  This patch allows it to free all
	indirect blocks at all heights.  In the case of the bugzilla,
	the users would run gfs2_convert on a gfs file system and
	afterward, gfs2_fsck would find a number of blocks that should
	have been freed, but were not.

	Remove splice_read file op for jdata files.
	bz 436811 - Some files with inherit_jdata flag will not allow reads from apache

	The splice_read op is supported for normal files but not
	journaled files.  Rather than return a bad return code
	when invoked, this removes the splice_read op from the
	file ops for jdata files.  That enables callers to find
	an alternative method of accessing the jdata file rather
	than failing the operation.

	[FENCE] Support for 'metadata' option for fencing agents / default values
	Fencing library now understand new 'metadata' action which shows
	available commands (for use on stdin). Output should be compatibile
	with stonith agents. Currently it is just partial (parameters only).
	We will extend it according to what we really needs. It should be
	possible to use these metadata for building UI. Device options now
	contains 'short description' and earlier option 'order' was added so we
	can set the correct orded (it will be same as in --help).

	Default values are now stored in fencing library as they are used for
	metadata generating. Fence agent can set their default settings to all_opt.

	There is a bit of redundancy ('required') because we will check it later.
	But I was not able to describe requirements without using not-naive schema.

	Grab hold of journal-turned-RG buffers so they're not freed.
	bz 471618

	This is addendum patch 3 for bug 471618.  The problem is, we
	weren't making a claim on buffers that used to be for the journals
	under GFS, but now are RG space for GFS2.  So the buffer may go away
	especially when running gfs2_convert on a file system that's full.
	When the buffers are released at the end, they may not really
	exist any more, which caused a segfault.  Grabbing hold of the
	buffer ensures they won't go away, so freeing them will work as
	normal.

	mkfs.gfs2 hangs with many journals
	bz 471618

	This is the addendum 2 patch for bug #471618.  There are
	two fixes: (1) switches the order back to normal (reverse)
	when freeing buffers.  This ensures the oldest buffers are
	freed before the more recent, which is what we want and
	how it was originally.  (2) The get_first_leaf and
	get_next_leaf code were making the faulty assumption that
	the buffers they're searching will be in memory.  That may
	not be the case, especially if the buffer order is incorrect
	(as in fix (1)).

	Use jbsize for height computations on journaled files.
	bz 475488

	This is an addendum patch for bug #471618.
	Without this patch, users may encounter an infinite loop
	in mkfs.gfs2 if the number of journals causes the block
	size to be exceeded for the per_inode system directory.
	For a block size of 1K, specifying five journals on
	mkfs.gfs2 will cause this problem.  For a default 4K block
	size, you would likely need 17 journals to get the hang.

2008-12-01  Bob Peterson  <rpeterso@redhat.com>

	Fix many bugs with gfs2_convert.
	bz 471618 - GFS2: gfs2_convert is broken

	Functional changes to the code are as follows:

	1. Original problem is fixed

	The original problem reported in the bug was caused because
	there is a fundamental shift of indirect block pointers between
	GFS1 and GFS2.  For indirect blocks, GFS1 added 64 bytes of
	reserved space after the gfs meta header.  GFS2 did not.  That
	meant GFS1 could hold fewer pointers than GFS2 on the same block.
	The meant code had to be added to gfs2_convert to shuffle all
	the pointers around to their corresponding gfs2 locations.
	This was not a simple calculation because of sparse files.  For
	example, with a 1K block size, if you do:

	dd if=/mnt/gfs/big of=/tmp/tocompare skip=496572346368 bs=1024 count=1

	the resulting metadata paths will look vastly different for the
	single block of data:

	height    0     1     2     3     4     5
	GFS1:  0x16  0x46  0x70  0x11  0x5e  0x4a
	GFS2:  0x10  0x21  0x78  0x05  0x14  0x78

	It is relatively easy to calculate the new metapath, but you
	can't just shuffle a pointer from its old location to its new
	location because the destination slot might be used for a
	different source slot.  In the example above, we couldn't just
	move the pointer at height 3 from offset 0x11 to another block
	at offset 0x05 because there might already be a pointer at 0x05
	being used for something else.

	To complicate matters, we could not just assign new blocks and
	copy the data because we should be able to run on a "full" file
	system.  So I had to write a complex new function called
	adjust_indirect_blocks along with several support functions.
	Someone else might be able to write a function to get the job
	done simpler, but at least this one works for both sparse and
	fully-packed metadata trees of several heights.  It basically
	formulates in memory a metadata tree for all the data blocks,
	clears out all the metadata buffers, and lays them all back down
	again according to the new layout.

	2. Improved error checking

	I added some badly needed error checking.  That's because I was
	running into problems and wanted to eliminate the possibility
	that errors were occurring, but not being reported.

	3. Improved progress reporting

	With a large number of resource groups, I saw long periods of
	time where the program would just sit for five minutes.  I was
	afraid that the tool had hung, so I kept breaking in with gdb
	to check on the tool's progress.  But if I'm that concerned
	about what it is doing when it's quiet, so too will be the
	customers who are anxiously trying to watch its progress.  So I
	added periodic reports of progress through the RGs when converting
	inodes, and also an occasional "." when the RGs themselves are
	being analyzed and/or manipulated.

	Same goes for writing out the new gfs2 journals.  The journals in
	gfs2 are quite different and we need to write them out entirely,
	all 128MB.  That takes a fair amount of time going through the
	functions in buf.c.  So I added a new message when each journal is
	written, so that the code doesn't appear stuck for a long period
	of time.  This could still use some improvement, but it's better.

	I also modified the progress messages to make them more clear.
	For example, the message "Removing obsolete gfs1 structures"
	sounded to me like it could cause alarm or panic to a customer.
	So I rephased it to "Removing obsolete GFS1 file system
	structures".

	4. Journal size was not being preserved

	In testing, I discovered that if the source file system had 32MB
	journals, the reformatted GFS2 file system had 128MB.  I decided
	that's not good and decided to fix it.  That is especially
	important if the file system is "full" to begin with because we
	can't add more blocks.

	5. Fixed a segfault dealing with buffer management.

	by the random data it would copy into the logfile name.

	gfs-kernel: workaround for potential deadlock. Prefault user pages
	The bug uncovered in 461770 does not seem fixable without a massive
	change to how gfs works.  There is a lock ordering mismatch between
	the process address space lock and the glocks. The only good way to
	avoid this in all cases is to not hold the glock for so long, which
	is what gfs2 does. This is impossible without completely changing
	how gfs does locking.  Fortunately, this is only a problem when you
	have multiple processes sharing an address space, and are doing IO
	to a gfs file with a userspace buffer that's part of an mmapped gfs
	file. In this case, prefaulting the buffer's pages immediately
	before acquiring the glocks significantly shortens the window for
	this deadlock. Closing the window any more causes a large
	performance hit.

	fence: IPMI over lan timeout adjusted and configurable
	This patch adjust timeout to default value 10s which
	should be enough for most today IPMI implementations.
	It also removes retries, because this job is done
	by fenced.

	Because some devices still need longer timeouts,
	timeout is adjustable by parameter -t (or timeout for stdin
	and XML configuration).

	This should fix BZ: 401481, 276541 and 452894

	GFS2: gfs2_edit savemeta doesn't work with GFS
	bz 471239

	This patch fixes several problems when saving and restoring
	GFS and GFS2 metadata when the block size is not the default
	of 4K.  Some of the problems fixed:  (1). GFS and GFS2 have
	different starting offsets and lengths for indirect block
	pointers.  This required a number of code adjustments.
	(2). The journal index information is kept differently in GFS,
	so I had to change how the journal index buffers were managed.
	(3). The GFS dinode structure is slightly different from GFS2
	and that was throwing off calculations because the di_height
	value was in the wrong location.  Smaller block sizes made it
	worse (more blocks and a bigger height required for the same
	information).  (4) GFS1 indirect pointer blocks look like
	metadata whereas GFS2's do not.  As a result, gfs2_edit was
	improperly truncating those blocks for GFS1 (trying to avoid
	capturing user data versus metadata).

	group_tool: show groupd compat info
	Show the groupd compatibility mode in output of group_tool ls.

	Suggest 'group_tool ls -a' if compat mode is 0 and groupd was
	queried (without -a) instead of the daemons.

	fence_tool: refuse to leave if dlm lockspaces exist
	We already checked for mounted gfs/gfs2 filesystems and refused to
	leave if any were found.  We should also refuse to leave if any
	dlm lockspaces exist.

	dlm_controld: clear plock syncing flags
	When a bunch of nodes all join a new lockspace together, no one will
	have any plock state, and no one will do a checkpoint to sync plock
	state to others.  We just need to recognize when that happens and
	clear the need_plock and save_plock flags; the routine that completes
	the syncing process won't ever run to do it.

	fence: Fix bug in make_args()
	A bug in make_args() caused it  to always return an error code,
	even if we formulated a perfectly good set of arguments.

	Basically, eventually ccs_get_list returns -1 when all items are
	exhausted, so the check at the bottom of the function would free
	any arguments we had (correctly) set up and return an error code,

	fence: New fence agent for VMware using vmrun command.
	This agent is based on other idea, than previous one and works on
	VMware ESXi (previous one didn't).

	Main idea of previous agent was connect to ESX via ssh and there run
	vmware-cmd command. This command looks deprecated and maybe will not
	available in next version of ESX. ESXi have bigger problem, because
	ESXi doesn't have ssh administration console.

	This agent will directly connect to VMware via native API and doesn't need
	ssh allowed on ESX host. Problem is, that you must install vmrun command
	by hand (available from VMware web pages as installer) on every node you want
	to do fencing of VMware guest machines.

	Either this, or another invokation to KBUILD. This is faster :)

	init scripts: major rework to make them distro agnostic
	- adapt build system to generate init scripts on the fly to respect some

	- create top level headers to set vars and defaults for/from each
	  distribution.

	- remove absolute path calls to standard distribution tools (pidof,
	  kill, etc).

	- replace few functions from /etc/init.d/functions with local ones when
	  those ones are not available.

	- rework the output redirection across board to fix several race
	  conditions during normal operations.

	- fix some statements that are now invalid in bash3.

	- fix cman status to skip ccsd if it's not being selected specifically.

	- standardize LOCK_FILE all over.

	- fix killing process for qdisk and rgmanager to use standard distro
	  tools.

	- substitute "action" with normal rtrn parsing in gfs and gfs2 init
	  scripts.

	- fix clulog usage in rgmanager init script.

	- generally avoid to fork external process to gather return statuses.

	All of the above tested on Fedora 10, Debian and Ubuntu.

	gfs-kernel: Bug 466645 - reproduceable gfs (dlm) hanger with simple stresstest
	GFS used to attempt to prefetch inode/iopen locks in readdir
	in the anticipation that stats will be called on the dirents
	returned. Running a simple 'find' without stat, resulted in
	wasteful prefetching and poor performance to the point that
	it seemed like find was hanging the system.

	This patch performs prefetch on a directory's inodes based
	on a stat-rate. i.e the rate at which stats are performed on
	the dirents returned by readdir. If there are a significant
	number of stats being performed, we enable prefetching.
	Otherwise, readdir is performed without prefetches.

	gfs2: randomize creation of temporary directories for metafs mount more
	a07d8d56e945a265f3da2857ad1316f49c4ae157 didn't add enough security to
	the whole random mount point.

	This change:

	- introduces a better randomness in mount_gfs2_meta by using mkdtemp
	  (this is a required change for security reason).
	- the use of mkdtemp makes the whole dir_exists code unrequired (hence
	  removed by the patch).
	- we force each tool to create its own meta mount. This fixes any
	  possible race conditions between tools (and thanks to the use of mkdtemp
	  that will guarantee the creation of a unique mount point). It also makes
	  find_gfs2_meta function unrequired (hence removed by the patch).
	- cleanup struct gfs2_sbd of unrequired fields.
	- cleanup the cleanup_metafs code path.
	- cleanup exit path from mount_gfs2_meta.
	- simplify code around different tools by using mount_gfs2_meta only.
	- turn lock_for_admin static.

	do not have support for this operation, yet. In some cases we can overload
	get_power_status() as we just need to cache result in other cases it will

	@note: Current implementation for APC will list just outlets on one device.

	gfs-kernel and mount.gfs2: GFS ignore the noatime and nodiratime mount options
	Since the vfs moved the MS_NOATIME, MS_NODIRATIME flags
	from the superblock to the vfsmount structure (MNT_NOATIME,
	MNT_NODIRATIME, which are not accessible to gfs), gfs no
	longer knows when to enable/disable atime updates and the
	atime_quantum stuff is broken in the sense that it doesn't
	respect the noatime and nodiratime flags.

	This patch attempts to fix this by creating a gfs-specific
	mount option gfs_noatime and having the mount.gfs helper
	pass it along when the user specifies noatime or nodiratime
	in the command line. It's not the ideal way to fix it, and
	it is a bit ugly.

	Revert "gfs-kernel: bz457473 - GFS ignore the noatime and nodiratime mount options"

	gfs-kernel: bz457473 - GFS ignore the noatime and nodiratime mount options
	This patch corrects noatime support in GFS. It works by ditching the special casing which we had previously and using the support already in the VFS layer.

	The problem which this solves was introduced a while back when noatime became a per-vfsmnt flag rather than a per-sb flag. GFS was still assuming that this flag would be passed to the fs, whereas in reality it was being horded by the vfsmnt code and not being passed to the fs.

	As a result of this patch, GFS will not only obey the noatime flag correctly, but also relatime and these will also be supported per-vfsmnt rather than on a per-sb basis as before.

	This fixes bz #457473

	gfs-kernel: GFS: madvise system call causes assertion
	Since the madvise system call was enabled by the patch to bug 429343, it's

	This causes an assertion (bug 464837)

	GFS: fsid=cl102a:gfs1.1: warning: assertion "(gh->gh_flags & LM_FLAG_ANY) ||

	GFS: fsid=cl102a:gfs1.1: time = 1222739610

	held. (madvise syscall case)

	When the gfs_fsck ran into a problem and asked whether to fix

	cman: honour the dirty flag on a node we haven't seen before
	The dity-node code used to check if a node had been down before
	honouring the dirty flag, this was to prevent nodes already in the cluster
	from kicking each other out at a transition.

	This had the problem that it could not detect if a new node joined that already had state (eg a new cluster started up in a split network).

	So, now we also check the 'first_trans' flag in the transition message so
	that we know when the node has newly joined a multi-node cluster.

	GFS2: sync buffers to disk when rewriting superblock
	bz 461290

	GFS2: mount during fsck protections not working.
	When gfs2_fsck is run, it is supposed to rewrite the locking
	protocol in the superblock to "fsck_xxxx" (e.g. "fsck_dlm")
	to prevent all cluster nodes from mounting the file system
	while gfs2_fsck is running.  The data was being written out,
	but the buffers were not synched to disk.  That created a
	timing window where processes could still mount the file
	system.  This was uncovered by the gfs2_fsck_stress test.
	This fix syncs the buffers to disk before continuing.
	Note that this still does not prevent users from running
	gfs2_fsck on file systems that are still mounted, but that is
	the way it has always been in the past.

2008-09-03  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	fenced: joining daemon cpg to bypass fencing
	When the fenced daemon starts, it checks for uncontrolled instances
	of gfs/dlm, and if none are found, it joins a special "daemon" cpg (not
	the fence domain cpg).  This join simply tells fenced on other nodes
	that the new node is in a cleanly reset state and they can skip fencing
	it if it's currently a victim.

	Currently, fencing is skipped if the victim just joins the cluster, but
	this is not sufficient since a node can join the cluster with uncontrolled
	gfs/dlm instances (it still needs to be fenced).

	In cluster2, the groupd cpg filled the role of this new fenced cpg in
	advertising the clean/reset state of a node.

	The LDAP loader assumed the old obdb behaviour that objects entered into

	cman: cope better with malformed config files
	A config file with

	It was previously the job of the config modules to move
	items like <totem>, <logging> etc from under <cluster> and into the
	root of the tree so that corosync could find them. This is
	obviously absurd.

	So I've made cman-preconfig do this now. This means that the
	config modules do only what they should do, read in the
	config tree as they see it into objdb. Any other new
	keys we need to add to /cluster that actually apply to corosync
	can be added in one place.

	GFS2: Make gfs2_fsck accept UNLINKED metadata blocks
	bz 460327

	Originally, GFS2 did not use a block type of 2 in the bitmaps,
	so it was considered invalid.  However, GFS2 now uses that
	block type to indicate unlinked metadata blocks.  This allows
	for cases where an inode is unlinked on one node while still
	open on another node.  This fix changes gfs2_fsck so that it
	ignores these blocks (eventually the file system will reclaim
	them) rather than reporting them as errors.

	init.d/cman: use fence_tool -m for two node clusters
	bz 460190

	Use the new fence_tool -m option in the cman init script for two node
	clusters.  This delays fence_tool join when both nodes aren't members.
	The delay allows initial cluster partitions (due to badly configured
	network/switches) to converge before starting fencing.

	fence_tool: new option to delay before join
	bz 460190

	Certain network/switch settings cause nodes to form partitioned clusters
	when they start up.  Add code to better cope with these initial partitions.
	The network partitions are a particular problem for two_node clusters where
	a node has quorum when it starts up on its own.

	This adds a new fence_tool option -m, e.g. fence_tool join -m <seconds>.
	It causes fence_tool to delay the join by up to <seconds> to allow all
	nodes in cluster.conf to become cluster members.

	This allows openais on the nodes to all see each other before starting
	the fence domain. So we join the domain *after* the nodes merge into a
	single cluster.  If we joined the domain *before* the cluster partition
	merged, then nodes end up being fenced unnecessarily.  (This is a similar
	idea to post_join_delay; a delay that gives us time to determine that a
	node in an unknown state is actually ok and doesn't require fencing.)

	groupd: fix daemon quit on SIGTERM
	The daemon can quit immediately on SIGTERM if running in LIBCPG mode,

	- change all instances of <asm/semaphore.h> to <linux/semaphore.h>
	- change all calls to permission() to inode_permission()
	- change all calls to remote_llseek() to generic_file_llseek_unlocked()

	I have been able to successfully compile with the patch against Steve's git
	tree, insmod the gfs.ko module, and mount a nolock filesystem using it. I don't
	have a cluster running upstream bits, so I couldn't test the module in a
	cluster.

	gfs_controld: queries in libgroup mode
	Most of the query info doesn't apply when running in LIBGROUP mode,
	but some of the basic info can be provided.

	libdlm: handle truncated device names
	When lockspace names are over 15 characters long, they result in a
	device name that's over 19 characters long, e.g. dlm_0123456789ABCDEF.
	Sysfs truncates device names at 19 characters, so the device name for
	this lockspace is /sys/class/misc/dlm_0123456789ABCDE, which udev also
	uses to create the device node, /dev/misc/dlm_0123456789ABCDE.

	So, when libdlm waits for udev to create the device node, it needs to look
	for this truncated name.  It then creates and removes symlinks with the full
	lockspace name.

	Joel Becker identified the problem and came up with this solution.

	cman (mainly): use corosync
	This patch changes cman to use corosync, the new split-up version
	of openais. It's mainly name changes, and changes to accommodate
	the new corosync API.

	It also changes the includes of other services from openais/ to corosync/
	though I can't guarantee I've caught all of them.

	libccs: add support for /child::*[%d]/ for xpathlite
	xpathlite did not understand the concept of child::*[%d]
	within a path (ex: /cluster/rm/child::*[1]/@name).

	This operation is required by rgmanager to load the service tree.

	rgmanager: unbreak locking in clulib
	commit 1edb73bd098500d459c16797da2377a59f1ef180 introduced a set of
	checks for read/write operations.

	the error checks in cman.c where wrong and caused endless loops in
	rgmanager startup.

	fix those checks by making them "dumb" since we don't really care
	about the result of the operation directly, but other bits of code
	will take care of those.

	mkfs.gfs2: should have an optional fs size parm
	bz 450764

	This patch fixes two problems with the previous patch for
	an optional "blocks" parameter to mkfs.gfs2.  The bugs
	are: (1) If the blocks specified is too big, it gave a wrong
	message.  This fixes the message and prints out what the
	numbers are (to help the user get it right).  (2) If the
	number of blocks was specified, the device size was reported
	incorrectly.

	dlm_tool: handle all join flags
	Add the ability to set all join flags, and print the flags being

	libdlm: remove device node creation/removal
	It's unnecessary as udev has been doing it for quite a long time.
	(Doing this ourselves also won't work correctly in the future with a
	pending dlm patch that will allow multiple creates and only the final
	release actually releases the lockspace.)

	config: fix objdb2xml filtering
	ais/corosync has a set of extra information on the toplevel
	tree that includes <service service_id="" handle=""
	that contains values for service_id and handle that cannot
	be converted into XML data.

	We were filtering for <service to avoid importing non-compliant data
	but that was catching also /cluster/rm/service making it impossible
	to use rgmanager.

2008-08-06  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	gfs_controld: register with dlm_controld earlier
	dlm_controld now allows us to register interest in a lockspace
	before the lockspace is created, so do it right away instead of
	after mount(2) completes, which has the potential of being too late.

	dlm_controld: allow early fs_register
	fs_controld daemons need to register their interest in a lockspace
	during startup before they've actually joined the lockspace, which
	means we need to record the registration before the lockspace exists
	and then set the registered flag when it's created.

	build: properly respect non standard libdir and incdir
	We allow users to set libdir and incdir to non standard locations.
	Those values need to be propagated properly within the build system

	build: drop "all" dependency from install: targets
	this change should address the last problem reported by
	Joel.

	build: fix several issues related to install and build targets
	Several users have been reporting issues building and installing
	our source from an nfs mount.

	There are two related issues in this scenario (P = Problem):
	P1) nfs servers often drops root privileges to nobody (very often required
	    for install:)
	P2) our build system had issues in the past with linking against static
	    libraries.

	the combination of the two ends with a user "nobody" trying to link
	one of our tools at install time and of course it fails because the
	nfs server would refuse "nobody" to access a directory/file that
	the user owns.

	We address this issue by doing a set of simple changes around
	(A = Action):

	A1) Remove all PHONY targets so that at install time we do not re-link
	    bits that are already updated.

	A2) Introduce a more detailed dependecy tracker for static libraries by
	    using LDDEPS var within the affected Makefiles. This replaces the
	    requirement of PHONY targets in A1).
	    Note: changes to header files are already tracked by .d files,
	    LDDEPS tracks changes to the binaries.

	A3) Make sure that all target that requires static libs are updated to
	    use LDDEPS.

	Extra benefits from this change (B = Benefit):

	B1) no relink at install time.

	B2) install target does not require any devel library installed on the
	    target system because of B1

	B3) install target can be executed in parallel from several machines.
	    For example when installing on N machines from the same nfs share.
	    This was an issue before because of a race condition now fixed by B1.
	    (two or more machine could try to link the same binary at the same
	    time and fail)

	The only con is that A2 requires a bit more manual work on tracking
	linking against static libraries, but the changes in that area are
	not frequent enough to hold this fix.

	ip.sh: add sleeptime parameter

	gfs2_edit: Improved gfs journal dumps
	bz 450004

	This patch adds three important improvements to journal dumps:

	1. It now recognizes and dumps GFS1 log descriptor continuation
	   blocks and dumps them correctly.
	2. It now prints a marker where the journal wrapped so you
	   can locate the most recently added entries easily.
	3. The absolute block number of the journal block is now
	   printed with the entries (in addition to the journal offset).
	   This makes it easier to find the correct journal block you
	   need to see.

2008-07-30  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	gfs_controld: use group_mode detection
	The new default is to use group mode detection from groupd.
	This is -g2 (command line) or <group groupd_compat="2"> (cluster.conf).

	dlm_controld: use group_mode detection
	The new default is to use group mode detection from groupd.
	This is -g2 (command line) or <group groupd_compat="2"> (cluster.conf).

	fenced: use group_mode detection
	The new default is to use group mode detection from groupd.
	This is -g2 (command line) or <group groupd_compat="2"> (cluster.conf).

	groupd: detect group_mode
	command line -g2, or cluster.conf <group groupd_compat="2"/>

	If old cluster2/RHEL5 nodes are in the cluster, cluster3 nodes will
	adopt the groupd compatibility mode to interoperate with them (this
	is the compat mode you get directly with -g1 or groupd_compat="1").

	If no cluster2/RHEL5 nodes are in the cluster, cluster3 nodes will
	use the new group mode that doesn't go through libgroup, and is not
	compatible with cluster2/RHEL5 nodes (this is the non-compat mode
	you get directly with -g0 or groupd_compat="0").

	This new mode (groupd_compat="2") is the default to favor the case of
	rolling cluster2->cluster3 upgrades, where cluster2 nodes and cluster3
	nodes need to interoperate in a single cluster for a limited time.  After
	all cluster2 nodes have been upgraded to cluster3, groupd_compat="0" can be
	added to cluster.conf the next time the entire cluster is taken down.

	It is still best to set groupd_compat="0" in cluster.conf for:
	. new clusters that don't require compatibility with cluster2 nodes
	. old clusters that are taken offline while the nodes are all upgraded
	  from cluster2 to cluster3

	init: standardize init scripts to /etc/sysconfig/cluster
	Allow users to set everything from one single external config file

	Retain backward compatibility by sourcing the old files and warning
	about the change.

	If a config option is present in both old and new file, the value from
	the new file will be used.

	misc: clean up "char const *" vs "const char *"
	this is cosmetic from a C point of view, but the perl xs preprocessor
	complains about it.

	while at it, clean up the typemap file that can be empty now.

	build: clean up perl bindings build system
	create a generic make/binding-passthrough.mk to use Makefile.bindings
	because the final Makefile is create by perl

	[CMAN] Display the node's votes in cman_tool status
	I'm not sure how this one slipped the net.

	[CMAN] pass COROSYNC_ env variables to the daemon
	cman_tool makes its own environment for the aisexec daemon to
	use but some newer config modules like to have configuring environment
	variables. So now cman_tool passes down all environment variables
	starting with COROSYNC_ down.

	To make this work, I've also changed the plugins that currently
	take environment variables to name them COROSYNC_.

	Yes, I know we're not using corosync yet, but this is just

	New sysconfig variable FENCE_JOIN will control whether or not the

	gfs2_edit: was parsing out gfs1 log descriptors improperly
	GFS2 log descriptors have 8 bytes per entry which represents
	a block number.  GFS1 log descriptors have a small structure
	that is 16-bytes, the first 8 bytes of which is the block.
	So gfs2_edit was mistaking the extra 0x00000000 for a GFS2
	end-of-block marker when it shouldn't have.  This fixes it.

	gfs2_edit: Ability to enter "journalX" in block number.
	With gfs2_edit, you can position to the "block #" field and
	press <enter>, then enter a block number to jump to.
	You may also enter a keyword, like "root" to jump to the
	root directory, "rindex" to jump to the rindex, etc.
	Most keywords worked, but you could not enter "journal0"
	to jump to the first journal until this fix made it possible.

2008-07-17  Christine Caulfield  <ccaulfie@redhat.com>

	[CCS] Make ccs_tool/ccs_test more consistent
	After much chatter, these tools are more consistent.

	ccs_test exists for old and new code, and always returns the
	old format output.
	ccs_tool query always returns new format output and the -c
	flag has been removed.

	[CCS] Fold ccs_test into ccs_tool and tidy
	Move all the code from ccs_test into ccs_tool and make it
	switch depending on argv[0]. Also add ccs_tool query that
	does full XPath queries on confdb.

	When build with LEGACY_CODE set ccs_tool will behave as it
	used to, talking to ccsd. Without that it will use the
	new confdb system and assume that ccsd is NOT used for
	distribution of cluster configurations.

	[FENCE] Bug #448822: fence_ilo doesn't work with iLO
	New fencing agent for iLO used ssh/telnet to connect, but unfortutely
	there is a problem with power off. This is why we need to use SSL connection
	and RIBCL commands. As there is no (?) telnet with ssl connection in RHEL we
	need one to be able to use same infrastructure as in other agents. This agent
	was not tested with RIBCL version < 2.0 (these part where just ported from the
	old perl fencing agent)

	@todo: we have to put telnet_ssl.py somewhere, I'm not sure where

	[gnbd-kernel] bz 449812: disallow sending requests after a send has failed.
	This fix adds a "corrupt" flag to the gnbd device structure. This flag is
	cleared when a new socket connection is opened to the server. It is set
	whenever a send fails.  After this all future sends will fail, and the receiver
	process will stop accepting replies as soon as it notices the flag.

2008-06-19  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	gnbd-kernel: Fix receiver race
	It is possible to have the gnbd receiver process finish and end a request before
	the sending process has finished using the request structure.  This can cause a
	kernel panic.

	This fix adds a waitqueue (tx_wait) and a pointer to the request currently
	being send (current_request) to the gnbd device structure.  current_request is
	set before any request is sent to the server. When the send is complete, it is
	cleared and the wait_queue is woken.  A new function, wait_for_send() is called
	whenever it is possible for a call to gnbd_end_request() to interleave with a
	send. It waits on the waitqueue if the request about to be ended is currently
	being sent.

	dlm_controld: use started_count to detect remerges
	Count then number of times the dlm has been started locally and

	I think this should work to detect remerges after transient

	[CCS] Detach dependency on ccsd to run the cluster
	The old static libccs is now called libccscompat and should not be used
	by anything outside ccs/. Note that the headers and the library are not
	installed, nor configure knows about it. All application paths that require
	compat are made static and non-configurable.

	Allow ccsais and ccs_tool to use libccscompat.

	Stop linking ccsd with libccs. It was not required before either.

	Add new shared library called libccs that uses aisexec confdb directly.
	The new libccs retains API compatibility with the old library so it was
	possible to "unplug" the old and "plug" the new one in one go. All the
	applications in the stack are now quering aisexec db directly.

	NOTES:
	 - the new library does not emulate all the libccscompat calls as some
	   of them are not used anywhere but this is not a problem since libccs
	   was static. We are shipping it now shared and we a new soname.
	 - the library implements only a small subset of xpath to query the aisexec
	   config db.

	Port ccs_test to use the new libccs and drop all calls that are not used anywhere.

	Set new default ccsincdir and ccslibdir to ccs/libccsconfdb in configure.

	NOTE to developers: you will need to rerun configure.

	This remove the external depandancies from the aisexec config

	the dependancy on logsys.
	Also, I've remove the totemip function calls and replaced them with
	usable subsets in the config code itself.

	The cman and ccs config plugins now work with testconfdb in

	gfs_controld: retry recovery for withdrawn journal
	bz 442451

	This is unfortunate, but seems to be the best solution available.  The
	problem, described more fully in the bz, is that when gfs_controld tries
	to do recovery on a journal for a withdraw, the withdrawing node may not
	yet have cleared its dlm locks.  This means the journal lock may still be
	held by the withdrawing node, causing all the recovering node(s) to fail
	acquiring it, and no one does the recovery.  The solution is for all
	recovering nodes to retry recovery of a withdrawn journal until they
	succeed (only the first to get the journal lock will actually recover
	it, the others will see it's recovered and report success.)

	gfs: don't cancel glocks when writing to hidden file
	bz 438268

	When glock.c sees the PRIORITY flag, it cancels any outstanding
	glocks prior to doing the lock request.  lock_dlm also uses the
	PRIORITY flag to give give granting priority to the lock in the
	dlm.  Both of these are necessary when the PRIORITY glock is used
	for recovery, but only the second is wanted (neither is really
	needed) when writing to a hidden file.  A new GL_NOCANCEL_OTHER
	flag, combined with PRIORITY, is used to tell glock.c to not do
	the cancels.

	dlm_controld: max name length sanity
	Define MAX_LS_NAME 64, and note that it should match MAX_LOCKSPACE_LEN in
	dlmconstants.h.  Including linux/dlm.h directly is difficult because some files
	need to include libdlm.h which doesn't combine nicely with linux/dlm.h.

	libdlm: max name length sanity
	Attempting to bring some sanity to handling of max lockspace name length
	and max resource name length.  A new kernel patch creates single authoritative
	definitions in linux/dlmconstants.h:

	define DLM_LOCKSPACE_LEN       64
	define DLM_RESNAME_MAXLEN      64

	These definitions are copied in libdlm.h so that user apps don't need to
	include the kernel header.  libdlm itself uses the dlmconstants.h
	definitions, and now checks both resource and lockspace name params against
	these definitions before calling into dlm-kernel.  dlm-kernel checks each
	of the input names against these definitions when creating a new rsb or ls.

	fix bz277781 by accepting "nodename" as a synonym for "node"

2008-04-09  Ryan O'Hara  <rohara@redhat.com>

	Fix help message to refer to script as 'fence_scsi_test'.

	Attempt to register the node in the case where it must perform fence_scsi fencing but is not registered with the device(s) that must be fence. With SCSI persistent reservations, in order to do a "preempt and abort" (which we are using to fence a node), the node doing this operation must be registered with the device. This fix will check to see the the node that is performing the fencing is registered with the device(s). If it is not, then it attempts to register with the device(s) so that it can then continue with the fence operation normally. Note that this situation should never happen, especially if things are configured properly.

	Allow 'stop' to release the reservation if and only if there are no other keys registered with a given device. Prior to this fix, if was not possible for 'scsi_reserve stop' to unregister/release on the node that was holding the reservation.

	Record devices that are successfully registered to /var/run/scsi_reserve.

	Rewrite of get_scsi_devices function. It is no longer possible to use lvs to get a list of cluster volumes (and underlying devices) at fence time. For this reason we must "keep state" by recording which devices we register with at startup. The init script (scsi_reserve) will record each device it successfully registered with to a file (/var/run/scsi_reserve). Then, and fence time, the fence_scsi agent will unregister each device listed in the state file.

	Fix success/failure reporting when registering devices at startup. If our node (key) is already registered with a given device, do not report failure since this is misleading.

	Replace /var/lock/subsys/${0##*/} with /var/lock/subsys/scsi_reserve.

	Fix split calls to be consistent. Remove the optional LIMIT parameter.

	Fix code to use get_key subroutine. Fix sg_persist commands to specify device via -d parameter.

	Remove "self" parameter. This was used to specify the name of the node performing the fence operation, and was passed to the agent. This is no longer used. Instead, we get the name of the local node in the agent by parsing the output from 'cman_tool status'.

	Fix unregister code to report failure correctly.

	Variable should be quoted in conditional statement.

	This assertion shows up when gfs_readpage gets called without the inode glock

	This patch unlocks the page, locks the inode glock and returns
	AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE.

	I had to change gfs_glock_is_locked_by_me() to return the holder if glock is
	held or NULL otherwise (instead of the TRUE/FALSE integer value it used to
	return earlier).

	I also added a new GL_READPAGE flag. If we need to get an inode glock in
	gfs_readpage(), this flag is set on the holder. We must not unlock another
	holder that we might have had on the glock before we entered gfs_readpage;

	release_version can now be a random string that will be shown
	when asking for tool versions. When specified from the configure
	it will override the one specified in make/official_release_version
	as previously documented (ex: VERSION "2.02.01").
	If not specified anywhere it will be generated by somajor.sominor.

	NOTE to developers: you will need to rerun configure to regenerate
	make/defines.mk.

	NOTE to packagers: sorry about this intrusive change but the problem
	was noticed too late. Removing --release_major/minor/micro from your
	configure invokation should be enough and usually those values should be
	set by upstream. While we provide an easy option to override values,
	please try to keep them consistent with upstream for easy tracking of bugs
	vs released versions.

	NOTE to release manager: make/official_release_version is not tracked
	in git and should now contains 2 keywords to work properly (order is not
	important).

	[CMAN] valid port number & don't use it before validation
	cman_send_data didn't validate the port number. This was
	not a great problem, but it was slightly silly.

	cman_start_recv_data used the port number before validation
	in a debug message, this could crash the server if debug

	[CMAN] Limit outstanding replies
	This commit imposes a limit on the number of outstanding replies
	that a connection can have. This is to prevent a DoS attack that
	causes cman to eat all available memory by sending lots of requests
	and not reading the replies.

	The deafult is 128, it can be set in cluster.conf as
	<cman max_queued="1000"/>

	[CMAN] Free up any queued messages when someone disconnects
	When a client disconnects we need to go through the list of
	queued replies to get rid of any that have not been collected.

	[CMAN] Make cman cope with the new objdb structure
	Now the /cluster bits are held on the objdb below "cluster"
	we need to look for everything (well, nearly everything)
	under there.

	Also add a 'cman_tool dump-db' command which is only built
	in DEBUG mode.

	[CCS] Fix the config loader for good
	We were removing the "/cluster" top level domain to allow /cluster/totem
	and other random ais bits to be at the top level of the objdb since
	aisexec expects to find them there.
	This is not clean in several way because it would break queries like:
	/cluster/child::* by returning a bunch of top levels objdb that are
	internal to aisexec and we don't want to expose to everybody.
	This is achieved by doing a few tricks here and there.. best would be
	to allow objdb symlinking.
	First we load the special bits for aisexec at the top level by using
	the right path within the xml config and then we load (again) the whole
	configuration.
	The final result will have some duplicates entries but for now we can
	live with that. The overhead is minimal.

	groupd: purge messages from dead nodes
	bz 436984

	In the fix for bug 258121, 70294dd8b717de89f2d168c0837c011648908558,
	we began taking nodedown events via the groupd cpg, instead of via the per
	group cpg.  Messages still come in via the per group cpg.  I believe that
	that opened the possibility of processing a message from a node after
	processing the nodedown for it.

	In Nate's revolver test, we saw it happen; revolver killed nodes 1,2,3,
	leaving just node 4:
	1205198713 0:default confchg left 3 joined 0 total 1
	1205198713 0:default confchg removed node 1 reason 3
	1205198713 0:default confchg removed node 2 reason 3

	the processing of the 'cman_tool version' command updates the

	Remove unrequired distclean targets

2007-12-21  Fabio M. Di Nitto  <fabbione@ubuntu.com>

	Collapse all common clean: target bits into make/clean.mk generalclean: target.
	Update all relevant makefile's to use generalclean.

	Required by this change:

	all TARGETS need to be defined before sourcing *.mk files to allow
	simpler var expantions.

	update all makefiles as a consequence

	apply alpha sort :)

	Remove obsolete and unused Makefile

	Install forgotten dlm man pages.

	Collaps all man Makefile's common snippets into man/man.mk
	Change all man Makefile's to use it.

	From now on it will be enough to source make/man.mk and add a TARGET=
	with the man page.

	A long time ago we did start collecting common Makefile snippets in one location.
	This time we shrink all common objects rules in make/cobj.mk

	Use newly defined $(OBJDIR) to source .mk files snippet. This reduced the hardcoded paths in Makefiles to one to include defines.mk and makes it easier to change stuff across the tree in one shot.

	Fix clean target

	Minor objdir rework to extend flexibility.
	the first shot of objdir implementation implied that you did:

	cd cluster
	./configure --objdir... etc.
	cd /path/to/objdir
	make

	now you can:

	mkdir objdir
	cd objdir
	/path/to/configure
	make

	NOTE: in this case you don't need to specify objdir. it will be automatically
	      set up for you.

	As a nice side effect you can also be anywhere on the fs and do:

	/path/to/configure --objdir=/path/to/obj
	cd /path/to/obj
	make

	and it will work.

	Fix 2 corner cases when setting up the objdir:
	- do not symlink symlinks.. this allows to setup multiple objdirs within the
	source tree.

	- do not copy/symlink defines.mk from other trees or bad thing happens.

2007-12-20  Fabio M. Di Nitto  <fabbione@ubuntu.com>

	* globally rename BUILDDIR to SRCDIR to reflect what it really is.
	* top level configure:
	 - add --objdir=/path option (default to current tree - it does not change
	   current behaviour if not specified and different from current tree)
	 - add a perl subroutine to handle symlinks
	 - check and setup /path
	 - switch all libdirs to use the objdir directly
	 - propagate objdir to make/defines.mk

	NOTE: those changes require 2 perl modules that should be available everywhere: Cwd 'abs_path'; and File::Basename;.

	NOTE2: you will need to rerun ./configure after applying the patch.

	* make/defines.mk.input:
	 - suck in OBJDIR from top level configure
	 - define THISDIR as a relative path from the top level.
	   For example: if PWD /usr/src/cluster/cman/lib, THISDIR will contain
	   cman/lib.
	 - define S as full path to SRCDIR/THISDIR/

	* all Makefiles:
	 - convert includes path to use $(S) and always point to the source as
	   defined in make/defines.mk.
	 - fix all object generation targets to use $(S).
	 - fix all install targets to $(S) where required.

	* Random cleanup:
	 - ccs/daemon/Makefile: do not kill files that are not around.
	 - dlm/tool/Makefile: use ${dlmincdir} and $(SRCDIR)/group/dlm_controld/
	   instead of relative paths and do not include itself as there are no
	   header files. Also use ${dlmlibdir} for linking.
	 - fence/Makefile: change build order as this is required to avoid extra
	   hacks due to shared C files around.
	 - gfs/gfs_fsck/Makefile: fix symlinking to be relative and not absolute
	   or the symlink is useless.
	 - gfs2/fsck/Makefile: likewise.
	 - gfs2/mkfs/Makefile: likewise.
	 - gnbd/utils/Makefile: create bits. This is to avoid even more hacks than
	   fence/Makefile to cope with shared objects. One day we will need to
	   review all of this.

	Cleanup leftovers from the very old build system. We were using a very complex way to set release_major and release_minor because in the old system it was not possible to set them directly from ./configure.
	Remove the old cruft since ./configure can now take those values directly in
	input.

2007-11-29  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Reinstate 'cman_tool join -X', allowing people to start a cluster without the hassle of a cluster.conf file. There are some caveats to this, which are mentioned in the man page.

2007-11-28  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	A performance optimization for plocks.  This speeds up locks that are repeatedly accessed by processes on a single node.  Plocks used by processes on multiple nodes work the same way as before.  The optimization is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting
	  <gfs_controld plock_ownership="1"/>

	in cluster.conf, or by starting gfs_controld with "-o1".  It is disabled
	by default because enabling it breaks compatibility with previous versions
	of gfs_controld.  If all nodes in the cluster are running this version,
	then plock_ownership can be enabled.

	The plock_ownership mode needs extensive testing.  This also introduces
	some minor changes when plock_ownership is disabled, so new testing is
	also required in that mode.  Abhi and I worked on this together.

	Resolves: bz 291551: gfs2_fsck clears journals without asking.

	Minor correction to the previous commit.  Bopping through indirect pointers was inadvertently changing variable "block" during savemeta.

2007-10-18  Robert Peterson  <rpeterso@redhat.com>

	While working on bz #291551, I discovered that gfs2_edit savemeta only saved true metadata, but we need more than that.  There are lots of blocks that are considered "data" (not metadata) by the RG bitmaps that we still need to save.  These include: 1. All the system journals (which may contain both metadata and    user data, disguised as data blocks within the journal).  We    need to pick out the parts that do not contain user data. 2. The system files, such as statfs, inum, quota file, etc.    These may be helpful in debugging user problems. 3. Indirect block pointers, which may be counted as data for    accounting purposes, even though it's metadata. 4. Directory leaf blocks.
	This change allows gfs2_edit to save and restore these blocks properly,
	and also to print out a breakdown of a saved metadata file:
	gfs2_edit printsavedmeta /tmp/gfsmeta

	It also improves on the information given when a journal is dumped.

	Do nodedown events when the confchg for the groupd cpg arrives, instead of when the per-group cpg confchg's arrive.  This means all nodes should have agreed ordering on the sequence of confchg's and messages, since all messages go through the groupd cpg.
	This should fix bz 258121 but I can't reproduce anything like that
	bug to verify.

2007-09-07  Fabio M. Di Nitto  <fabbione@ubuntu.com>

	So in this first patch (that seems the most urgent one):
	- Make prefix default to /usr

	- Clean up all prefix use around configure (this will make alternate
	  prefixes like /usr/local works properly).

	- Add a specific --aisexecbin option that is passed to cman_tool build.
	  This change defaults to /usr/sbin/aisexec (default aisexec install
	  path) but also allow local override if you have aisexec installed in
	  different paths.

	3 NOTES:

	- the cman_tool change has not been tested in production. It builds and
	  shows that the path is passed properly.

	- all people that use a prefix=/ will need to make sure to use some
	  extra configure options to respect FHS (for example to install man
	  pages in /usr/share/man rather than /share/man..).

	- If this patch goes in CVS, you need to make sure to re-run ./configure.

	Detection and resolution now works with my basic deadlock tests.
	Had to rework how lock state is assembled.  The previous method was
	simpler and just gathered the master lock state from all nodes, but
	I failed to realize that the xid (transaction id) isn't synced to
	remote master copy locks.  So, now all lock state is saved in the
	checkpoints, both master-copy and process-copy (containing the xid)
	which are then merged to give the full view of the lock.

	Added ability to parse and print journal information.  For example: gfs2_edit -p journal2 /dev/roth_vg/roth_lv
	Also added the ability to jump relative block numbers.  This is for
	when you jump to a block by "editing" the block number:
	Cursor up to block number, press <enter> to enter destination block.
	Before you could type a structure or block number.  Now you can type
	in a structure, block number, or relative block number.  For example,
	if you're on the superblock (block 0x10) enter +0x300 will take you
	to block 0x310.  This number may be in decimal or hex and may be
	positive or negative.

	recent cleanup of warnings should have specified unsigned in long long casts

2007-07-17  Robert Peterson  <rpeterso@redhat.com>

	I added the ability to recurse indirect blocks.  That means that you can now print a list of all blocks associated with a file. For example, you could print all block numbers associated with journal0 by doing something like:
	gfs2_edit -p 0x19 /dev/roth_vg/roth_lv

	assuming, of course, that you know that block 0x19 contains journal0.
	(You can use gfs2_edit -p jindex <dev> to get that information though).

	I fixed some bugs with restoremeta where it was dying if the
	metadata to be restored was bigger than the destination file system
	could hold.

	I made restoremeta do some "warm fuzzy stuff" to report its
	progress of the restore operation so the user doesn't think the
	restoremeta is permanently hung.

	I renamed some long variable names to short ones to make the
	code less wordy.

	I fixed a minor segfault if you hit "j" when your cursor is
	on the block number of the hex view.

	I probably should have committed these changes earlier rather than
	save them up, but some of my changes had serious regressions and I
	didn't have time to sort it out and fix it until just now (I didn't
	want to commit a broken version to cvs.)

	Bugzilla 242759:
	Bump into this problem while debugging bug #236565 (GFS SPECsfs panic).
	Apparently a minor oversight while adding new function into GFS for
	RHEL5. GFS versions <= RHEL4 is immuned from this issue.

	Upon memory pressure, VM starts to release inode cache entries that would
	fail gfs iget. GFS1 flags this error as "ENOMEM" but returns from gfs_create
	call without releasing the glock.

	Bugzilla 236565
	Fix a race between GFS lookup code and VM cache reclaim logic kicked off
	under memory pressure. At the end of the lookup, gfs releases inode glock
	pre-maturely.  This creates a window inside the bottom portion of logic
	that could make gfs_iget updating the associated GFS inode structure that
	has been freed. Depending on who gets the new memory, unspecified corruptions
	occur.

	In the case where this bug is found, it corrupts TCP buffer head that ends
	up trashing nfsd kernel stack.

2007-05-25  Wendy Cheng  <wcheng@redhat.com>

	Apparently we can't remove these two methods from file operations table. Since gfs_read() had been changed to use do_sync_read() that requires to have aio defined in the file operations table.
	So vector read/write (implies NFSD) will be partially broken again after
	we put these two methods back.

	use dlm/Makefile to build lib and tool dirs

	add dlm_tool, can be used to join/leave lockspace

	Make new features available based on recent dlm kernel patches.
	The kernel patches change the user/kernel device interface used by libdlm.
	(You'll need the new dlm_device.h kernel header installed on your system
	to build the lib.) libdlm is backward compatible with the old kernel
	interface, but some of the new features will return errors on old kernels.

	New API's provided by libdlm:
	- dlm_new_lockspace() is just like dlm_create_lockspace() but has a flags
	  arg so flags can be passed when creating/joining a lockspace.
	- DLM_LSFL_NODIR and DLM_LSFL_TIMEWARN are new flags that can be used with
	  dlm_new_lockspace().
	- dlm_ls_purge() is new and can be used to purge orphan locks.
	- all DLM_LKF flags can now be used with dlm_lock* routines (flags above
	  16 bits couldn't be used before)
	- new DLM_LKF_TIMEOUT flag to enable lock timeouts
	- dlm_ls_lockx() is new and adds "xid" and "timeout" args

	All previous API's are still available, and programs compiled against
	previous versions of libdlm should still work.

2007-05-09  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	People seem to think that they have to setup lvm in rgmanager even though they are using clvm.  This causes the two to collide during use.

	pretty self explanatory, this code is not used anywhere. Get rid of it.

	When the project switched away from magma, we forgot to enable IPv6 for cluster_base_port. The patch fix that and add some checks that were marked as TODO in the code.

	both libccs and daemon were building and linking common/log.c. Make libccs sucks in log.o and make ccsd link against libccs. Also fix ccs top level makefile to build in proper order.

	allow to specify --fence_agents="list of fence agents" at configure time.
	default is to build all of them and add a little help section.

	The detection of available list is done by checking

	It also does another round of Makefile cleanup and fix the Makefiles for
	previously DISABLEDAGENTS.

2007-04-18  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	Bug 236580: [HA LVM]: Bringing site back on-line after failure causes pr...
	Setup:
	- 2 interconnected sites
	- each site has a disk and a machine
	- LVM mirroring is used to mirror the disks from the sites

	When one site fails, the LVM happily moves over to the second site -
	removing the failed disk from the VG that was part of the failed
	site.  However, when the failed site is restored and the service
	attempts to move back to the original machine, it fails because
	of the conflicts in LVM metadata on the disks.

	This fix allows the LV to be reactivated on the original node
	by filtering out the devices which have stale metadata (i.e
	the device that was removed during the failure).

2007-02-09  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	clear configfs stuff if we get SIGTERM, this is a convenience if you want to kill dlm_controld and remove the dlm module without leaving the cluster.  Otherwise you have to manually clear configfs dirs.

	If the only two groups were two dlm lockspaces, then during recovery, the first would detect the all_nodes_all_stopped condition and move on to the starting state, and the second would never get a chance to detect the all_nodes_all_stopped state since the event state of the first was no longer FAIL_ALL_STOPPED.  Use a separate flag to indicate that the all stopped state has been reached instead of relying on the event state.

2007-02-08  Robert Peterson  <rpeterso@redhat.com>

	Fixed some bugs and made some improvements. When displaying indirect blocks, it now gives the data offset. Also added page-up/page-down/home/end navigation to block list display.

	groupd creates uint32 global id's for each group.  It doesn't use them itself, but provides them to each registered app to use if it wants.  (The dlm and gfs each use the global id in messages to distinguish between different lockspaces/fs's.)  groupd's method of creating these gid's (local counter | local nodeid) can result in duplicate gid's in the cluster given a somewhat uncommon sequence of events. bz 221629

	Support mounting a single fs on multiple mount points. bz 218560

2006-12-19  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Fixes related to the needs_recovery state and first-mounter recovery. Probably not perfect yet, but working in the tests I'm able to contrive. bz 218551

	When the first mounter is recovering all the journals, it should use TRY on the journal locks.  There's one rare case where other mounters will exist who hold journal locks that we don't want to block on.  That's when the other mounters are readonly, haven't been able to recover the fs after a node failure, and the next rw mounter is told to do first mounter recovery.  The journals of these readonly nodes can be skipped when the pseudo-first mounter is going through all journals.  Changed this a long time ago but never checked it in. bz 218551

	groupd's function that returns info for group status queries was mistakenly setting the "member" status to 0 when a node was leaving. This led fence_tool to believe that the local node was no longer a member (i.e. had finished leaving) when in fact the leave wasn't complete yet. bz 219385

	Call into the lock module to do a withdraw instead of just calling BUG. bz 215962

	When lockfs is called from the vfs (due to a dm suspend), don't try to do the lockfs if the fs is being shut down (due to a withdraw). bz 215962

	Pass gfs_controld the device being mounted, it'll use this if it needs to withdraw the fs. bz 215962

	Before doing the mount-group portion of withdraw, fork off a dmsetup to suspend the fs device.  This means gfs doesn't need to call dm_suspend() in the kernel before calling out to us.  The suspend waits for all outstanding i/o to return on the device which is necessary prior to telling other nodes to do recovery.  (Later we should probably swap in an error table and resume the device.) bz 215962

	Be more intelligent about handling recovery sets so we can deal with cases where a node fails, rejoins, then fails again before recovery has completed for the first failure.  Also handles case where the groupd process exits without the node going down.  If that happens, we want to kill the node (via cman) if the node was in any groups and ignore it otherwise.

	use timersub() macro to subtract timevals instead of coding it

	fix a couple of problems if openais enables flow control: - the poll loop spins due to plocks being ready to process but being   ignored due to the flow control; we need to remove the plock fd from   the poll set when flow control is enabled (just like we do when the   plock rate limiter is active) - we were not updating the flow control state from openais when   flow control was enabled unless we received a cpg message; we need   to update it periodically while blocked since we may not receive   cpg messages from other nodes causing us to update the state

	Resolves: bz211465 fsck errors on gfs2 volume

2006-11-14  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Default plock rate limit of 10 instead of 0.

	Add plock rate limit option -l <limit>.  Current default is no limit (0). If a limit is set, gfs_controld will send no more than <limit> plock operations (multicast messages) every second.
	Given a limit of 10, one file system where plocks are used, and a program
	that does a tight loop of fcntl lock/unlock operations, the max number of
	loop iterations in 1 second would be 5.  If eight nodes were all doing
	this there would be 80 total network multicasts every second from all
	nodes in the cluster.

	We also record the volume of plock messages accepted locally and received
	from the network in the debug log.  A log entry is written for every
	1000 locally accepted plock operations and for every 1000 operations
	received from the network.

2006-11-10  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	fix for bz215095 & 215099.
	for 215099, gnbd now only handles signals in sock_xmit() when it is called by
	the gnbd_recvd process. Otherwise, it simply blocks the signals until it
	completes the IO. This keeps gnbd from sending partial requests to the
	server, which can lead to data corruption.

	for 215095, the gfs function clean_journal() now uses the noinline attriubute,
	gfs_find_jhead() only uses on struct gfs_log_header, and gfs_recover_journal() dynamically allocates its struct gfs_log_header, all to conserve stack space.

	In the gnbd function sock_xmit(), you no longer get the signal info, so
	gnbd_recvd cannot print which signal it received, but it saves over 120 bytes
	of stack space.

	Fix #211701 (rgmanager + clustat hangs), #211933 (xenvm rename -> vm)

2006-10-23  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	Really gross hack!!! This is a workaround for one of the bugs the got lumped into 166701. It breaks POSIX behavior in a corner case to avoid crashing... It's icky.
	when NFS opens a file with O_CREAT, the kernel nfs daemon checks to see
	if the file exists. If it does, nfsd does the *right thing* (either opens the
	file, or if the file was opened with O_EXCL, returns an error).  If the file
	doesn't exist, it passes the request down to the underlying file system.
	Unfortunately, since nfs *knows* that the file doesn't exist, it doesn't
	bother to pass a nameidata structure, which would include the intent
	information. However since gfs is a cluster file system, the file could have
	been created on another node after nfs checks for it. If this is the case,
	gfs needs the intent information to do the *right thing*.  It panics when
	it finds a NULL pointer, instead of the nameidata. Now, instead of panicing,
	if gfs finds a NULL nameidata pointer. It assumes that the file was not
	created with O_EXCL.

	This assumption could be wrong, with the result that an application could
	thing that it has created a new file, when in fact, it has opened an existing
	one.

	Patch from Abhi to fix case where a node's mount is rejected by other group members causing gfs_controld on the mounter to leave the group immediately.

	Bugzilla 203170 - direct IO deadlock: We'll have the same deadlock as described in bugzilla 173912 without RHEL4 kernel DIO_CLUSTER_LOCKING flag. To work around this issue, the i_alloc_sem is dropped from GFS. We expect glock will be able to handle the local synchronization.

	This is the fix for bugzilla bug 210369: acls are not enabled after remount.

The gfs and gfs2 mount helper (/sbin/mount.gfs2) was aborting if it saw mount options that are not part of mount.h (i.e. internal to mount and vfs).  The fix is to add the missing options so the mount helper will recognize them properly.

	Fix an effect of recovery mixed with joins where the node whose join event was interrupted by the recovery can sometimes not have its g->joining flag cleared which would cause a later unmount to hang.

	The corresponding changes to the gfs_controld changes in handling mixed mounts and recoveries and failed mounts.  We now tell gfs_controld when our mount has completed and the result using the same connection that we created when requesting the mount.

	Handling a lot of hard situations in the areas of: - recoveries mixed with mounts in lots of different ways - mount failures while lots of nodes are mounting in parallel
	(Part of this is also an update to mount.gfs, both gfs_controld and
	mount.gfs need to be updated together.)

2006-10-06  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	This is a big batch of code that gets us further along the path to handling recoveries mixed with joins (gfs mounts).  The test I've been using to work on this is inserting a BUG() at the start of gfs_lm_get_lock() on six of eight nodes and then mounting on all of them in parallel.  We should end up with the two nodes without the BUG properly mounted and the six with the BUG properly recovered.

	- check cpg flow control status from openais when processing plocks - handle case where we're mounting and the only other mounted node   fails -- we need to become the first mounter if we've not begun   mount(2) yet - journal recovery requests need to be fed serially to gfs, we weren't   doing that in the case where a gfs journal recovery was in progress   when another node failed

	gfs-kernel (gfs1) and gnbd-kernel are going to track the RHEL5 kernel in cvs head.  We want the default top-level build of cvs head to work on upstream kernels, though, e.g. 2.6.19, for people who are trying out upstream gfs2/dlm.
	So, comment gfs-kernel and gnbd-kernel out of the top level makefile.
	Once we create a RHEL5 branch, we can uncomment them there (and
	perhaps remove gfs-kernel and gnbd-kernel from cvs head.)

	A bit of a hack to cope with the race condition where dlm_controld gets the groupd callback before the cman one and tries to start a DLM lockspace before all the node addresses are known.
	I think this will fix bz#207197

	Add some extra semantics to CMAN to cope with openAIS rejoins. Basically, this adds an extra state to a node: AISONLY which is only cleared when cman receives a valid TRANSITION message from the node.
	A TRANSITION message is deemed to be invalid if the join_time of the node
	has not been changed (this is the timestamp the daemon was started) and
	the node has since been down and is rejoining. cman_tool will show if this
	is the case for a cluster by displaying the DisallowedNodes flag in the
	"cman_tool status command".

	If there are disallowed nodes in the cluster then the "cman_tool expected"
	command is disabled until those nodes have been removed.

	If there is any ambiguity then cman will mark the node as unfenced so that
	fenced can do the job anyway.

	This is a crosswrite from gfs1 for bugzilla bz 200883: gfs_fsck segfaults on very large file systems.  The same problem existed and is now fixed in gfs2_fsck and libgfs2.

	This is the fix for bugzilla 200883: gfs_fsck segfaults. The problem was that gfs_fsck was running out of memory for in-core bitmaps when run on very large file systems. For example, 45T requires about 11GB of memory.  This fix doesn't allow it to run, this just exits gracefully, tells them why, and how much additional memory is needed.

	ccsd is now fixed such that it will not daemonize until the socket is ready for communication. As a result, the sleep after starting ccsd is no longer needed.

	Moved code which signals parent (SIGTERM), which allows the parent process to continue and exit. This signal was occuring before ccsd had the sockets ready for communication, and as a result the cman init script would sometimes fail because the ccsd would daemonize before the socket was ready.

	Code that starts groups in order of level during recovery wasn't working right in the case where a node fails while mounting, i.e. node fails after it's joined the level2 mountgroup but before it joins the level1 lockspace.  Code now checks that all lower levels are recovered instead of just checking that level-1 is recovered.

	remove a couple log_error's

	show all options in help output

	There's been a relatively unusual problem explained in the comments that I'd been putting off fixing for lack of a nice solution.  Turns out this problem could crop up more often than hoped, so have had to fix it.
	1) mount.gfs asks gfs_controld to join mount group
	2) gfs_controld does and notifies mount.gfs to go ahead with mount(2)
	3) gfs_controld gets a stop callback for the group due to another node
	   mounting
	4) gfs_controld needs to wait for the kernel mount to complete before it
	   can stop/suspend the mount group (through sysfs)
	5) mount(2) fails in the kernel for whatever reason
	6) mount.gfs tells gfs_controld the kernel mount failed

	gfs_controld is waiting for the kernel mount to complete outside its
	normal poll loop, though, so it won't ever get the message in step 6, and
	will wait forever for the failed mount to actually complete.

	Added a pipe between mount.gfs and gfs_controld that mount.gfs just uses
	to send a failed mount message.  gfs_controld watches the pipe for this
	error message while waiting for the kernel mount.  mount.gfs uses unix
	socket ancilliary data to send an fd to gfs_controld.

	This change is for Makefile reform allowing a simple "make" command to recompile the entire cluster suite:
	1. All Makefiles have been changed to get rid of references
	   to "copytobin" and the bin directory.  This will
	   eliminate discrepancies between "bin" versions and
	   installed versions of the programs.
	2. The cman and group configure files have been modified
	   to allow linking properly to /usr/lib64 on x86_64
	   systems without specifying libdir.
	3. Fixed several problems relating to "make install"
	   not recompiling modified code.
	4. Fixed some dependency problems with gfs and gfs2 tools
	   that linked against libgfs and libgfs2 respectively.
	5. All Makefiles have been updated to use "make -C <dir>"
	   rather than "cd <dir> ; make" so that compile errors
	   won't charge ahead without stopping you.
	6. Deleted references to obsolete iddev library.
	7. Got rid of more "linux" symlinks for includes.
	8. Misc minor Makefile cleanup.

	The idea to have the last node that did the checkpoint try to reuse it even if it wasn't the low nodeid any more doesn't work because the new mounter tries to read the ckpt when it gets the journals message from the low nodeid before the ckpt is written from the other node.  Now, the low nodeid is always the one to create a ckpt for a new mounter which means a node saving the last ckpt needs to unlink it when it sees a new low nodeid join the group.

	'group_tool dump fence' will dump fenced's debug buffer

	keep 1MB circular buffer of debug messages that can be sent to a connected client

	From: fabbione@ubuntu.com
	This one was a nasty bug that was causing several issues.

	For example:

	mount -t gfs /dev/foo /mnt -> ok
	mount -t gfs /dev/foo /mnt/ -> nok failing with:
	can't find /proc/mounts entry for directory /mnt/

	(caused by read_proc_mounts in util.c when comparing with /proc/mounts
	that does not reference the trailing /).

	Other bugs are also fixed by making mo->dir consistent.

	mount -t gfs /dev/foo /mnt -> ok
	umount /mnt/ -> nok:
	/sbin/umount.gfs: lock_dlm_leave: gfs_controld leave error: -1

	because the mo->dir is also registered in lock_dlm daemon.

	This was causing a severe inconsistence that was blocking
	mounting/umounting
	or other volumes/devices.

2006-07-24  Ryan O'Hara  <rohara@redhat.com>

	Fixed typo. "ccstool" should be "ccs_tool".

	if mount.gfs is unmounting/leaving the group because the kernel mount failed, then don't wait for the kernel mount to complete before doing the leave

2006-06-20  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	don't skip fencing a node unless it's both a cman member and has fully started groupd

	- keep cman member list updated by using cman callbacks instead   of polling cman for the latest list every time we're interested - only bypass fencing of a node if it's both a cman member and   in the groupd cpg (has started groupd past the point of checking   for residual gfs/dlm state)

	Moving the cluster infrastructure to userland introduced a new problem that we didn't need to worry about before.  All cluster state now exists in userland processes which can go away and then come back like new, i.e. unaware of the previous state.
	Typically, when the userland cluster infrastructure on a node
	"disappears", another node recognizes this as a node failure and recovers.
	There's no problem there.  The problem is when the cluster infrastructure
	disappears on all the cluster nodes and then comes back.  The
	infrastructure that disappeared may have abandoned control of gfs/dlm
	instances in the kernel.  When the infrastructure comes back, it's like a
	brand new cluster, it knows nothing about the residual, uncontrolled
	instances of gfs/dlm.  New nodes would use gfs/dlm in this new cluster
	independently of the unknown gfs/dlm users from before and there'd be
	immediate corruption [1].

	Eventually, the infrastructure may be able to reconstruct the global state
	of abandoned instances of gfs/dlm when it comes back and reassert control
	of them, but that's not realistic any time soon.  For now, the
	infrastructure needs to recognize nodes with residual gfs/dlm state as
	failed nodes that need recovery (starting with fencing).  That recognition
	and recovery now happens as part of the startup initialization, before new
	instances of gfs/dlm are created [2].

	[1] This is trivial to demonstrate:
	- start up a cluster on nodes A,B,C
	- mount gfs on nodes A,B
	- run 'cman_tool leave force' on A,B,C
	- start up the cluster again on A,B,C
	- mount gfs on node C
	- nodes A,B are now using gfs independently of node C

	[2] The previous example now works like this:
	- start up a cluster on nodes A,B,C
	- mount gfs on nodes A,B
	- run 'cman_tool leave force' on A,B,C
	- start up the cluster again on A,B,C
	  i)  when groupd starts on A,B, it recognizes the uncontrolled instance
	      of gfs, kills cman locally and fences the local node [3]
	  ii) when C runs fence_tool join, a new fence domain is started which
	      fences nodes with an unknown state, which are A and B
	- mount gfs on node C

	[3] This self-fencing does nothing for node C which still needs to fence
	both A and B itself.  If A fences itself before C fences it, A will be
	fenced twice.  This self-fencing step is optional, but it can be
	convenient when 1) all the nodes restarting the infrastructure find
	residual gfs/dlm instances and 2) reboot fencing is used.  The anticipated
	situation is one where everyone has residual state so no one can start up
	to fence anyone else; all are stuck.  But, they all fence themselves,
	reboot and resolve everything.

	There's a different approach we could take that would be more convenient
	when not all cluster nodes are likely to be mounting gfs or SAN fencing is
	used.  In this case, a node that finds residual gfs/dlm instances would
	remain a cman member and not fence itself.  This would contribute quorum
	to help another node without residual state start up and fence it.

	The solution to this confusing situation is simple:
	- groupd now checks for residual gfs/dlm kernel state when it starts up
	  and if it finds any it kills cman and exec's fence_node <myname>.
	- fenced can't bypass fencing of a node unless the node is both a cman
	  member and has fully started groupd (a node may need fencing if it's
	  joined the cluster but groupd isn't starting).
	- the same consideration in fence_manual as fenced

	remaining withdraw bits now in recover.c

	Complete the code to support withdraw, not yet tested.  This also switches from using dlm locks for withdraw notifications to simply using messages.  The way the daemon now works allows a much simpler approach to withdraw than what we had before where we needed the dlm locks.  Setting up a dlm lockspace for the daemon was also an annoyingly heavy-weight step and the dlm kernel state of the daemon made cleaning up from crashes difficult.

	Significant reworking of how mounts are processed.  The previous approach couldn't deal with certain node failures that occured while processing a new mounter.

2006-06-08  Robert Peterson  <rpeterso@redhat.com>

	Misc bug fixes.  For example, it was not updating block free counts for fsck.

	Missed on initial check-in.

2006-06-08  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Set up a separate cpg for sending messages (e.g. for processing mount/unmount) instead of sending them through the cpg used to represent the mount group.  Since we apply cpg changes to the mount group async, that cpg won't always contain all the nodes we need to process the mount/unmount.  A mount from one node in parallel with unmount from another often won't work without this.
	Also fix the makefile to include headers from the kernel_src location.

2006-06-06  Robert Peterson  <rpeterso@redhat.com>

	Remove obsolete parts now in libgfs2.

	when finishing an unmount for a node, we shouldn't be checking it's recovery status as if it had failed (instead of unmounting)

2006-05-25  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	when unrecovered nodes are set to be recovered again after sequential node failures, we need to exclude nodes that are unmounting and don't need any recovery

	- re-enable the code that waits for the kernel mount in the finish()   for a mountgroup join.  should work better now with the recent   lock_dlm kernel change - we were missing a clear_new() call in the case of a first mounter   delaying its start_done() for a second mounter - we need to discard group messages on a node that's been added to   the cpg group but not yet added (asynchronously) to the app group

	check that the specified mount type matches the actual fs type on disk (magic number alone no longer does this since 1&2 have same magic #)

	retry cpg_join() when it returns ERR_TRY_AGAIN

	decrement the node count before printing debug info so we see the new value

	Changes to the way recovery events are handled when we're already in a recovery event.  Multiple recovery events are now merged most of the time.  Also fixes to the way groups depend on other levels for ordering of recoveries.

2006-05-16  Abhijith Das  <adas@redhat.com>

	bz191222 fix. When releasing a glock with GL_NOCACHE flag set, care was not taken to ensure that only one holder for the glock remained. This was corrupting the glock and preventing further access to the glock. FLOCKS use this GL_NOCACHE flag. See bugzilla for more information. This patch needs to go through a test cycle to ensure that it doesn't affect other code

2006-05-15  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Fix key file override.

	Get rid of some redundant calls

	Be careful about returning junk as a node address.

	Tidy some of the inter-file communications.

2006-05-13  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	When a node is joining a group, has been added to the cpg, but is still queued to be added to the app, and then fails, we just purge its join event for the app and shouldn't queue a recovery event for the app since it doesn't exist there yet.

	Handle case where none of the current members of the mountgroup can recover journals (they're readonly) and there are journals that need recovery.  The next rw mounter is told to recover all journals, and after it's done it needs to unblock access to the fs on the other readonly mounters. (This was mistakenly included in last checkin, it's not been tested yet.)

2006-05-12  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Comment out code that waits for kernel mount, it's not working in some cases.

	- id's where being removed from a recovery event's extended list too early, so multinode recovery processing was getting stuck. - when an extended recovery event aborts another event, the extended nodes in the rev weren't being marked stopped in the first event

	Mention ccs_tool as a way of adding nodeids to a cluster.conf file.

2006-05-11  Chris Feist  <cfeist@redhat.com>

	Fixed fence so includes the proper directory for cman. Fixed rgmanager's clulib so it includes the proper ccs directory.

2006-05-11  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	set stopped flag for rev->nodeid, not ev->nodeid

	When more than one node failed at once, creating an extended recovery event, we weren't updating both recovery sets (for both nodes) when we finished processing the event.

2006-05-11  Robert Peterson  <rpeterso@redhat.com>

	New and improved gfs2_edit tool based on ncurses. This replaces both gfs2_edit and gfs2_debug.

2006-05-11  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Fix some possible problems with overlapping recoveries, and cases where we could confuse a pending event for the recovery event in the checks that control whether recovery processing should wait.

2006-05-11  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Remove redundant kernel examples. Make userland examples compile cleanly.

	Return all multicast addresses. Also return a list of (cman) ports being listened on. Display both in cman_tool.

	Make the examples compile and do something.

2006-05-11  Ryan McCabe  <rmccabe@redhat.com>

	Ignore outlet groups

2006-05-10  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	A rag bag of stuff:
	- Allow override keyfile on cmdline
	- more selective help (eg cman_tool join -h)
	- Show if fenced in cman_tool nodes
	- Show node addresses in can_tool nodes
	- If no multicast set then encode cluster ID in a multicast address
	  to avoid clashes of clusters
	- add cman_get_node_addrs() to libcman (not fully implemented yet)
	- Some preparation for rrp in OpenAIS.

	Add facility to assign a multicast address to the cluster. This is (perhaps confusingly) part of the addnodeids subcommand which is really the V1->V2 upgrade command now.

	Don't go into an infinite busy loop if cman shuts down.

2006-05-09  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	bz 190200: cleaned up gfs2_tool to compile. Removed some features (gfs2 doesn't support them anymore) and commented some out for later implementation. Needs to be reviewed sometime in the future.

2006-05-03  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	When mounting a fs, we first join the mountgroup, then tell mount.gfs to procede with the kernel mount.  Once we're in the mountgroup, we can get a stop callback at any time, which requires us to block the fs by setting a sysfs file.  If the kernel mount is slow, we can get a stop callback and try to set the sysfs file before the kernel mount has actually created the sysfs files for the fs.  A new (untested) function delays any further processing until the sysfs files exist.

2006-05-02  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Untested fix for the case where nodeA fails, nodeB fails while recovering journalA, nodeC needs to recover both journalA and journalB.  nodeC wasn't retrying to recover journalA.

	make some names more descriptive of what they do

	build all order: cman/lib, ccs, cman

	An unused recovery set needs to be cleared in either cpg or cman callback, whichever comes second.  Last checkin also wasn't adding recovery_set to list when created by cman callback.

	fix logic that reduces debug output

	This should fix the trouble caused by nodes rejoining the cluster before they've been recovered (common with fence_manual).  There may still be some problem if the unrecovered/rejoined node fails again before the first recovery for it is done.

2006-04-29  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

2006-04-28  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	This needs libcman now too

	Use new OpenAIS with important CPG fix. cpg now tells you /all/ the nodes that left the cluster rather than just the first one.

2006-04-27  Robert Peterson  <rpeterso@redhat.com>

	Initial checkin of libgfs2.

2006-04-27  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	We can get more than one node reporting success in recovering the journal for a failed node.  The first has really recovered it, the rest have found the fs clean and report success.  Change assertion to recognize that.

	If a bug in a client results in them doing a startdone at the wrong time, catch and report it.

	When we get the extraneous recovery_done for our own journal when we mount, we need just ignore it.  Previous changes to recovery inadvertently added recovery processing to this case.

2006-04-27  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Use latest openAIS which, I think, will fix Dave's trouble

2006-04-27  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	When a recovery event arises while processing another recovery event, the first event continues to be processed through the stopping state before it's supplanted.  We weren't calling process_current_event() on it, though, so it wasn't going anywhere.

2006-04-26  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	recovery result values for success/gaveup reversed

	munge debug messages

	Major changes in handling recovery for failed nodes.  Previously, we assumed that if there was a node mounted rw, the journals of any failed nodes would be recovered.  The way mounts are done today, the last rw mounter could be unmounting during a recovery which means it may not do recovery.  To fix this, nodes now inform each other when they've successfully recovered a journal.

2006-04-25  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Inform cman when we have fenced a node.

	Fix hang if unmount overlaps recovery slightly differently, i.e. if unmount occurs between telling gfs to do recovery on a journal and getting a response.  (Last fix was unmount before just before telling gfs to recover a journal.)

	This should help fix a possible hang caused by a node failing at just the right time during our unmount.

2006-04-18  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Remove the restrictions on when readonly mounts are allowed.  As long as the fs doesn't need recovery, any mount mode (rw/ro/spectator) is allowed.

	If the last rw mounter umounts leaving only ro nodes, the remaining nodes don't need to leave the fs blocked like they do if the last rw mounter fails (and needs journal recovery).  This also means that an rw mounter that mounts when there are only ro mounters doesn't need to do first-mounter recovery except when there are actually journals that need to be recovered.

2006-04-13  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Add remount support which involves updating our mount mode (ro/rw) on all nodes. Fix 16/32-bit mixup in metaheader that was recently fixed in gfs2.

	This is a significant rewrite and expansion of the code that manages gfs mounts.  For the first time we are considering the mount mode (rw/ro/spectator) in the mount process and how it relates to recovery.  In the past, we've not dealt with the issues that come up when ro/spectator nodes cannot recover the fs.  This has only been tested up to the point of the previous functionality, there will still be bugs in the new areas.

	If it took too long for an uncached gnbd recvd process to stop after the server was fenced, gnbd_monitor would mistakenly think that the old dying process was a new starting process. Because of this, the client would not auto-restart the gnbd device when the server started back up. This is now fixed. Now, gnbd_monitor will not move a device from the reset state to the restartable state unless the old recvd process has stopped.

	Fix for bz 186125: gfs_fsck on GFS 6.1TB filesystem gives error and leaves volume in an unmountable state.

2006-03-24  Abhijith Das  <adas@redhat.com>

	cman init script fix for bz 159783. dlm module is modprobed immediately after cman module. Previously, dlm module was loaded after cman_tool join.

2006-03-24  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	If the user specifies hostdata options on the command line, they need to be combined with the standard hostdata options from gfs_controld.

2006-03-23  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	When we exit because the cluster has shutdown, do a force release of the abandoned libdlm lockspace to clear it up.  This requires a dlm-kernel change to use force=3 for libdlm's FORCEFREE.

	When starting up, also clear any old configfs dirs out of /config/dlm/cluster/spaces/.  Some may be left over for a defunct lockspace if the cluster shut down before the ls was left.

	Exit if we get POLLHUP from cman.

	Exit if we get POLLHUP on cman fd.

2006-03-23  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Loads more documentation for each call.

	Return EBUSY if we don't know whether a remote node "is_listening" or not.

	Make things a little clearer.

2006-03-21  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- ccs_tool can seg fault on upgrade bug 186121
	apcFence {
	        port = 6.2
	        switch = 1
	        option = "off"
	}

	When ccs_tool comes across the integers, it segfaults because it expects
	them to be strings.  This checkin fixes that.

2006-03-21  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	always reply yes to a cman shutdown, letting the daemons themselves determine when we can leave

	don't let the gfs_controld lockspace prevent a cman leave

2006-03-21  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	More documentation on API calls.

2006-03-20  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Daemons now exit when cman says the cluster is down.

2006-03-20  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix typo of the year: "quorumdev_poo"
	Don't get config variables from <cman config name="value"/>, just use
	<cman name="value"/>.
	Having "config" as a key in a config file is just daft,
	also confusing and a change from the RHEL4 syntax (not that this version has
	the same config variables, but there's no point in making it gratuitously
	different).

	"make install" now includes AIS headers & libraries.

	Use the cluster name as the AIS key if no keyfile is specified. This has a couple of advantages: - It allows isolation of clusters by name (as we did before, but /really/   by name this time, rather than a hash of the name). - It avoids the problem of aisexec crashing it it was not running with a key   and it encounters a packet that was.

	Tidy help message, fix cluster name override, tidy "status" code.

	clvmd no longer needs patching for GFS2

2006-03-18  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Reply to cman's TRY_SHUTDOWN callback.

2006-03-17  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	Fixing the get_uid code to make it easier to integrate with multipath

2006-03-17  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Respond to cman's TRY_SHUTDOWN callback.

	add \n to error message

2006-03-17  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	libcman doesn't ncessarily return a padded sockaddr_storage. But it /does/ return the length.

	We must register for events.

	OK, OK, I give in.

	Fix includes

	Try and keep ABI stable between versions. sizeof(cman_node_t) should match that in RHEL4

	Tidy up. and remove some unused structs & constants

2006-03-17  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	fixed gnbd so that it compiles with the upstream kernel.

2006-03-17  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	- If, when mounting, we receive the nodeid/jid message before processing   our first start, save the message to process after. - Release withdraw locks for remaining nodes when we get the terminate   callback for our leave instead of immediately when we initiate the leave.   Otherwise it can conflict with the releasing we do as we process other   nodes' unmounts that might be processed before our own.

2006-03-15  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	libcman changes for last one. Need to fix my CVS repository.

	two-phase cman shutdown.
	calling cman_shutdown() will send a REASON_TRY_SHUTDOWN event to all
	clients registered for notifications. They should respond by calling
	cman_replyto_shutdown() to indicate whether they will allow
	cman to closedown or not. if cman gets 1 "no" (0) or the
	request times out (default 5 seconds) then shutdown will be
	cancelled and cman_shutdown() will return -1 with errno == EBUSY.

2006-03-15  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	This is the gnbd code that is required for getting multipathing to work on top of GNBD.

2006-03-13  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Don't send extra state change message.

2006-03-10  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	sort listed groups by level sort members listed for each group by nodeid

	When nodes are removed from the cluster, remove their dir in configfs.  DLM changed to close lowcomms when this happens (it was wrongly closing lowcomms connection when node was removed from lockspace.)

	Add debug output showing the changes we get from cman.

2006-03-09  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	lock_dlmd now called gfs_controld

	changing lock_dlmd to gfs_controld in various places

	Rename the daemon binary from "lock_dlmd" to "gfs_controld". gfs_controld interacts with the cluster infrastructure on behalf of gfs file systems and controls/drives recovery of gfs in the kernel.  The old name was misleading, it looked related to the dlm instead of gfs.  The old name came from the fact that gfs_controld goes through the lock_dlm module when controling gfs.

	Enable withdraw functions by default since libdlm locking is now working fine.

2006-03-08  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	- don't process new non-recovery events while recoveries are   still pending (recovery_set's exist) - track progress of recovery sets and free them when they are   complete - before the start stage in recovery, make sure that we've received   a cman callback for all the failed nodes so we're certain to have   the correct quorum status

2006-03-08  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	Reorganize this directory to match the rest of the cluster tree.

2006-03-08  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Don't return an error if we had to create the control device! Return something slightly better than EEXIST if we can't create it.

	Odd things could happen if the lock space already existed but the device didn't. No longer.

2006-03-08  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	initial commit of csnap kernel code with a useful build structure.  The code itself is exactly as Daniel left it.  patches 00001 and 00002 are required to build the module.

2006-03-07  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Use latest AIS with CPG integrated into it. Fix "make uninstall" & "make clean"

2006-03-06  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Purge messages that get queued after we're added to the cpg group but before to our own join is processed.  Otherwise, these messages will just hang around forever.

2006-03-03  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Because cpg leaves are processed asynchronously, we can't use the cpg being changed to send messages; the actual cpg membership may not reflect the nodes we need to send/recv messages with.  Stopped and started messages sent during async confchg processing now go through a separate cpg that the groupd daemon joins itself and connects it to all other groupd daemons.
	Overlapping leave events now work (like you get if multiple nodes
	run fence_tool leave at about the same time), or leaves that
	occur while the group is processing a join.

2006-03-03  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Patch up so they compile. (mainly taking out query calls)

2006-03-02  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	- add version numbers to messages - byte swap messages - adjust event id in recovery events that include multiple failed nodes

	- Add extended event information that group_tool -v will print - All nodes now generate event id's for each confchg based on the   nodeid and event type.  Every message is tagged with the event id   it relates to so groupd can process only messages related to the   current event.  Needed when confchg's back up.

	api changed to unsigned id

2006-03-02  Steven Whitehouse  <swhiteho@redhat.com>

	Change the .gfs2_admin dir such that its no longer linked from the root directory, but becomes a separate root in its own right. If you want to use this version of GFS2, then you need the latest kernel sources from kernel.org. Note that the change made to the metadata is such that older filesystems will continue to mount ok, so updating mkfs is optional.

2006-03-02  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Fix how we dispatch cpg callbacks; dispatch one per poll() event. cpg_dispatch(ALL) breaks things if there's more than one confchg since we need to process each confchg before the next, and a loop around cpg_dispatch(ONE) doesn't work because it will block when there's nothing more to dispatch.

2006-03-02  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Remove some assertions that could fail in normal circumstances.

2006-03-01  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	check that the mount point exists and is a directory

2006-03-01  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Make sure p->ls is NULL when we start up. OR we could crash at shutdown. (lon: you might want to check this in other versions)

	Small reversion. The sequence number was pointless.

	change SaNameT to struct cpg_name. add a sequence number to the confchg callback. don't crash when program exits after a cpg_leave.

2006-02-28  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	- command string needs to be "setid", "set_id" wasn't recognized - improve some recovery debug messages

	- Basic recovery works. - Need to retry sending cpg messages when RETRY status is returned. - Finish bits for doing recovery in the middle of join/leave/recovery,   not tested yet.

2006-02-27  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	More descriptive debug messages. Check errors in various places where they were being ignored.

	Add -w option to disable the withdraw feature. Force it to be set since the dlm locking it uses isn't working.

	set the width of the name field dynamically so state info won't go past 80 columns as often

	Add event state to the set of group info we provide, and have group_tool print it so we can now tell what state the group is in, e.g. adding/removing/recovering nodes.

2006-02-27  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Don't clear too much !

2006-02-27  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	missed a line which broke the compile

	check for errors returned from group_dispatch()

	return an error from group_dispatch() if the read doesn't return the correct amount of data

	when a cpg connection is closed, also clear out the poll client entry for it

	Uncomment withdraw stuff that uses libdlm.

	don't need to zero out end of addresses any more

2006-02-27  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Make errno handling a little more consistent

	As a courtesy, zero the whole node address field.

	Return correct status sign for fundamental errors.

	Return the correct address length for a node. NOTE: This changes the protocol version number between libcman and cman,   so you MUST reabuild libcman and anything statically linked to it.

2006-02-24  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Only send jid's to new mounters, not everyone.

	- When we leave a lockspace, remove the configfs entries for it. - When the daemon starts, remove old configfs entries under comms/

	add debugging to determine if the mount syscall is stuck

	note to help clean up in case umount(8) doesn't call umount.gfs2

	- also build libdlm - mkfs type required: -t gfs2 (and -t <table> for mkfs.gfs2) - umount type required: -t gfs2, or umount.gfs2 won't be called - util-linux 2.13-pre6 version of umount(8) is required, older   versions won't call umount.gfs2 helper

	munge header for group listing

	use "gfs" instead of "lock_dlmd" as the group type printed by group_tool

	don't need to include dlm kernel headers

2006-02-24  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Now compiles against upstream (-mm kernel) DLM.

	Update patch so it works with new build system

	Don't need to override ${sbindir} anymore

	Fix some errors in usage. In particular, CLVMD /can/ be used with the new software - it just needs to be patched before building.

	Oops, slight bug in that Makefile there.

	This is a bit neater. The download is now always a clean OpenAIS tarball, and we patch it after download.

	Install and run cman from libexec

	Return an error if range locks are attempted.

2006-02-24  Steven Whitehouse  <swhiteho@redhat.com>

	Prevent "uninitialized block" message printing out since several blocks don't have the metadata header now.

2006-02-24  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Fixing leaves.

	update for new components

2006-02-23  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Fix the check for us being in the fence domain, libgroup isn't setting the "member" field at the moment, so just look through the member list.

	Fix leave processing, leaving node can't wait for stopped messages from remaining nodes.  Make global id consistently unsigned.

	match debug messages with the same ones in other daemons

	Comment-out withdraw stuff which depends on libdlm which doesn't match upstream dlm since we removed ranges.

	Remove some old state stuff that doesn't exist any more

2006-02-22  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Send messages (used for distributing journal id's and plocks) through libgroup which passes them through to libcpg/openais. libcman is now only used to check our nodeid and the cluster name.

	clean out a few unused bits

	Munging to get this compiling again; need to define new annotated types used in gfs2_ondisk.h, and need our own gfs2_xyz_in() functions since gfs2 now puts these in its own ondisk.c file.

2006-02-22  Steven Whitehouse  <swhiteho@redhat.com>

	Added a simple set of compile/install instructions.

2006-02-22  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	as per lon: add cman_get/set_private routines. Remove some redundant admin routines

	ln -sf doesn't do what I though it did. so rm the symlink before creating the new one.

	Use latest openais - with improved CPG support.

2006-02-21  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	remove unused file

2006-02-20  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Bugzilla 182057 - patch 3-3: Add dump_stack() into gmalloc so we could know the culprit whenever out of memory loop occurs.

	Bugzilla 182057 - patch 3-2: GFS was trying to split a full-grown directory (0xffff entries) hash leaf into two and subseqently hang. The buffer requirement 0xffff*sizeof(uint64_t)/2 = 262144 (256K) was too big for kmalloc to handle. Change into vmalloc if kmalloc fails.

	Bugzilla 182057 - patch 3-1: Fixes directory delete out of memory error. Found in customer environment where gfs_inoded is deleting a max size of hash unit (0xffff entries). It hangs in leaf_free() during gmalloc while kmallocing 0xffff*sizeof(uint64_t) (=512K) of memroy. It did a kmalloc, zeroed out the buffer, then copied the zeroed contents into bh buffer and subsequently sent the bh into gfs_writei to write out to disk. This patch removes the unnecessary kmalloc plus the memory copy by directly zero out the bh buffer.

	include headers from ../../cman/daemon/openais/trunk/include

2006-02-16  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Check if ccsd is running before attempting to start the daemon. Otherwise the user just waits around for nothing to happen.

	Allow stderr log messages from ais if "cman_tool join -d" specified.
	WARNING: Don't use this on a serial console with full debug messages
	enabled or it will repeatedly timeout !

	Give aisexec longer to get started. Now that all the CCS accesses are in the daemon it can take some time to get going.

	Run cman as an AIS component. This allows other AIS services to be used in conjunction with it - using their normal API.
	This checkin includes a few small hacks to openais to make it run without
	a configuration file - cman will supply all the config information to it
	from CCS.

	It also includes a new AIS service: cpg. This is a closed process group service
	I'll be submitting upstream soon but is currently used by groupd.

	As there is no AIS config file read by the daemon the services used are
	hard coded in openais/trunk/exec/mainconfig.c as:
	evs, clm, cpg, ckpt, evt, lck, msg, cman

2006-02-15  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Put this code back into the correct state.  (This is not supposed to be the same as the version on RHEL4 or STABLE branches. This is new.)

	add nodeid to message deliver callback

	Remove group_join/leave arg.  Need to find a new method for detecting if new mounter is spectator.

	Remove group_join/leave arg.

	Removed group_join/leave arg.

	Remove the "info" params to join/leave and other related functions. Add the API for sending/receiving.

	New groupd that uses the cpg (closed process group) service from openais. It still uses cman, but only to get the local nodeid and quorum values.

2006-02-15  Wendy Cheng  <wcheng@redhat.com>

	Joined work of bugzilla 164331 (Abhijith Das) and 178469 (specsfs):
	While granting exclusive lock, gfs_glock_cb() expects all other threads
	have relinguished their writes and journal has been flushed and shutdown.
	Otherwise it aborts the call and forces a filesystem consistency error.
	The current umount code (gfs_put_super) doesn't follow this logic by
	doing flushes without log shutdown before the exclusive lock is requested.
	The patch works around this issue by relocating the flushes into
	gfs_make_fs_ro() call itself after the gfs_glock_nq_init() call.

	Properly handle error return code from verify_jhead().

2006-02-09  Wendy Cheng  <wcheng@redhat.com>

	This patch is part of fix for bugzilla 178469 where the 6th word of the nfsd file handle doesn't get correctly byte-swapped in gfs_decode_fh(). It is normally not a problem if the dentry of the file still hanging around in server's cache. However, under heavy IO, the dentry could get re-cycled and the parent info would be used to re-do lookup. We get stale file handle error as the result.

	man page for fence_rsa

2006-02-08  Steven Whitehouse  <swhiteho@redhat.com>

	This takes mkfs out of the main build system. It should make it much easier to build it since its just a question of editing the Makefile to point at the kernel source and then, make, make install.
	Also the binary will be called mkfs.gfs2 and make install will stick
	it in /sbin so that you can call it through the mkfs generic front
	end like all the other filesystems do.

	So hopefully this will be easier to build and easier to use. It also
	incorporates the changes required to make filesystems for the new
	journaled file format, so be aware that only the very latest git
	tree of gfs2 will work with it.

2006-01-12  Steven Whitehouse  <swhiteho@redhat.com>

	GFS2 no longer writes mh_blkno into the common metadata header for metadata blocks that it creates itself. This completes the removal of the mh_blkno field. GFS2 doesn't check it at all, so it should be backward compatible with GFS1 now.

	mkfs no longer writes the mh_blkno field into the common metadata header since its not needed. Removed the bmap ioctl() call from live.c since its ownly purpose was to allow setting of this field.

	The second half of yesterday's patch. This is the recovery part and now means that gfs2 no longer relies on the mh_blkno field of the common metadata header.

	All normal (i.e. not journaled) file reads/writes now go via the page cache route, even if they are to stuffed inodes.

2006-01-11  Steven Whitehouse  <swhiteho@redhat.com>

	Remember to take out my debugging printks :-)

	Write a list of the block numbers of the succeding metadata blocks which are about to be committed into the log. This uses the spare space at the end of the log descriptor block, so mostly it doesn't actually require any more disk I/O to do this, and when it does, its very little.
	This doesn't actually change recovery (yet) since the recovery side is
	still making use of the mh_blkno field in the metadata header still. The
	intention is to use the list of block numbers instead. This has a slight
	speed advantage in recovery since we no longer need to read any block
	which is in the revoke list, since we will have already read a list of
	the block numbers ahead of time.

	Once this is done, we'll no longer need to use the mh_blkno field in
	the common metadata header which gives two advantages:

	 o We don't need the bmap ioctl() since its only use is the online version
	of mkfs
	 o We don't need to rewrite all the metadata headers when converting gfs1
	to gfs2

	I plan to use an almost identical system to deal with data blocks in
	the journal, with the addition of an extra field to flag whether the
	data block begins with the GFS magic number or not, which is required
	so that we can escape any data blocks which do start with the magic
	number. When thats done, it will greatly simplify dealing with
	journaled data files.

	Munging and renaming related to the merging of lock_harness into gfs.  For the time being, we copy the gfs1 lock module bottom interface so the same lock modules can be used with both gfs1 and gfs2 (it won't be possible to load both gfs1 and gfs2 at once.)  Eventually the lock modules will fork for gfs1/gfs2 and the register interface can change to the gfs2_ prefix.

	Some __read_mostly annotation.

	mkfs changes to allow building of filesystems with visible .gfs2_admin directory.

	This change makes the "hidden" files and directories visible to users of the filesystem. Basically it interchanges the order of the root and .gfs2_admin directories.
	There are still some more changes to come in this area, but this is a
	good start. Again you'll need to upgrade mkfs with the changes I'm about
	to check in to build a filesystem with this new feature.

	The plan is that this will remove the need for a large number (all?)
	of the current ioctl()s but I'll leave them where they are until I'm
	sure this is working correctly.

2005-12-14  Steven Whitehouse  <swhiteho@redhat.com>

	These are the fixes to mkfs in order to get it to build against the new big-endian GFS2 kernel source. I'm not intending to fix the other utilities until I've finished the ioctl() changes as that will break them again for a short while.
	If you do need them in the mean time, mostly its a question of adding
	linux/types.h to the include files list, s/le/be at suitable places
	and using the copy of ondisk.c now checked in here.

	Long term I'd like to abstract the things in ondisk.c and make a
	libgfs which all the utilities can share rather than each of them
	having their own copy of them.

	This touches just about everything and changes GFS2 to be big-endian on disk, like GFS1. At this point, most of the major data structures will be compatible in layout and endianess. There are a number of more minor items which are still not compatible, largely in areas where there really is a good reason to make changes.
	There will probably be further metadata changes to come, not least when
	I look at the ioctl question, which is next on my agenda as it will also
	require user tool changes.

	All the user tools in CVS for GFS2 are now broken until I check in
	some changes there (5 mins max I promise!).

2005-12-12  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix for bz 142849
	When you do gfs_write on a stuffed inode, you don't update the page cache,
	because the inodes are stored in the buffer cache. This doesn't effect reads,
	because gfs special cases the stuffed reads.  Unfortunately, sendfile needs to
	use the page cache, because it relys on the destination socket's sendpage
	routine to work. So my fix is: after you do a write on a stuffed inode, if the
	first page of the file is cached (It appears from looking at the code that
	there is already an assumption that stuffed inodes will never be more than a
	page in length) mark the cached page as not uptodate.

2005-12-08  Steven Whitehouse  <swhiteho@redhat.com>

	Removed the hfile_trunc ioctl(). Its not used anywhere at the moment, but I've kept the function itself (will produce a function not used compile warning) just for the moment as I've a hunch it will be useful later via a different interface.

	Tidy endianess conversion in lvb.c. Half the macros were not used anyway. We no longer convert endianess for the structure padding, and the printing code will no longer print its value.
	This is a precusor to a longer look at the endianess conversion and
	addition of sparse annotations.

	Fix up warnings due to kernel function prototypes not matching a couple of GFS2 functions.

	This patch moved the i_alloc structure into the incode inode. This results in fewer memory allocations (one less per write) as well as removing another of the __GFP_NOFAIL allocations from the code.
	I've left the get/put functions associated with i_alloc as it might be
	useful to retain them for debugging and because it maps out the lifetime
	of this structure.

	Temporary variable "error" is not required since there is already a variable being used for that purpose.

	This patch removes an allocation of memory which was occuring on every lookup of a block in a file. The memory requires is now allocated on the stack and its only 20 bytes. A lot less than some of the other stack allocated structures we are using (e.g. struct gfs2_holder) in the code.
	It should speed things up and removes one of the __GFS_NOFAIL allocations
	that we need to remove from the code.

	Fix to quota bug fix... I had accidently commited the RHEL4 patch in head as well. This is the proper fix for the head branch.

2005-11-29  Steven Whitehouse  <swhiteho@redhat.com>

	Sorry - another ondisk format changing check in...
	I've reordered the fields in the common metadata header and added a pad
	field so that this structure is now of identical size as in gfs1. It
	also has identically functioning fields in the same place.

	One new field is added, mh_blkno which contains the block number of
	the block in question. This is instead of the generation number used
	in gfs1's journaling and now no longer needed. The mh_blkno field is
	checked only once in the code and could be moved into the structure
	where its required, rather than being left in the common header. (I
	checked this with Ken who added the field in the first place)

	I have a thought that it might be a useful feature to have all ondisk
	metadata checksummed in which case this header field might be just the
	right place to put it.

	Also some padding is added to the dinode, sb and rgrp structures in order
	to make them compatible with the earier gfs1 versions. Again fields are
	now in the same places as in gfs1 with padding added where required since
	the fields have got smaller.

	I don't believe that there will be any significant performance impact in
	changing these structures, but it should make things much easier when it
	comes to migration.

	There are other structures (I think that the various directory metadata
	comes under this heading) where removing the padding is likely to
	improve performance significantly and so I'm intending to take a
	different approach there.

	There is likely to be at least one more metadata change for gfs2 in
	the not too distant future. My next main concern is to make gfs2
	bigendian on disk, to match gfs1. Beyond that, all the other changes
	should be much easier to cope with. I did a test recently and found that
	given a few 32bit fields to copy, adding endian coversion made about
	12% difference to the speeed of copying (which we are doing anyway).

	If we keep the two versions with the same on disk endianess then a lot
	of the metadata will not need conversion at all (given the changes in
	this patch). So an upgrade will be quite quick, rather than needing to
	rewrite each and every metadata disk block.

	This patch introduces the tty_write_message() function rather than doing the dereferences directly.
	Make this look like the code for ext2/3. I'm not sure about the test that
	I've left in the code here. ext2/3 doesn't have it and I suspect we don't
	need it, but I've left it for now just in case.

2005-11-23  Steven Whitehouse  <swhiteho@redhat.com>

	N.B. This patch changes the ondisk format of GFS2, so you'll need to remake filesystems.
	The idea here is to make the metadata closer to that of GFS1 in order to
	reduce the amount of work required to migrate GFS1 -> GFS2. This patch
	changes the numercial value of a few constants to match those of
	identical function in GFS1. One of the GFS1 constants is no longer
	used in GFS2 (as noted in the comments) and there are two new constants
	added.

	As far as I can tell there are no more constants in GFS2 which are
	not comaptible with those in GFS1. All the remaining ondisk
	incompatibilities are due to structures changing size and I'll
	be taking a look at those next.

2005-11-15  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	When using lock_dlm, all gfs2 unmounts would panic in invalidate_inode_buffers (<- invalidate_list <- invalidate_inodes). Invalidate_inodes requires that the sb inodes list not change while it's running, but async unlock completion callbacks from lock_dlm are scheduled during invalidate_inodes.  These callbacks do glock_put() which does a final iput(), clearing the inode and causing the panic.
	The fix is a new semaphore (sd_invalidate_inodes_mutex) which blocks
	glock_put's during invalidate_inodes.

	get block size from sb instead of defunct statfs

	comment out bits that used "statfs" entry in sysfs that's now been removed... need to find another way of getting at least some of that info

	/sys/fs instead of /sys/kernel

	base dir in sysfs is now /sys/fs/gfs2

	register gfs under /sys/fs instead of /sys/kernel. requires the kernel to be patched with fs_subsys.patch

	declares fs_subsys for /sys/fs/

	Port plock management from lock_dlm kernel module to lock_dlm userland daemon.  Simpler as it runs over cman comms instead of dlm range locks.

2005-10-12  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	use ALIGN instead of MAKE_MULT8

	last checkin for list_for_each_entry_safe_reverse was incomplete

	Add a couple comments.

2005-10-11  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	if the lock module returns LM_OUT_ERROR, withdraw from the cluster

	When the dlm returns an error, return LM_OUT_ERROR to gfs instead of panicking; gfs can then try to withdraw.

	define LM_OUT_ERROR for a lock module to return

2005-10-06  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	Update gfs2_tool to make use of sysfs instead of ioctls where appropriate.

2005-09-30  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Lock ourself in memory

	Don't send two config change events for a "cman_tool expected -e". Tidy kill message.

	Use inet_ntop() to print IP addresses so the look nicer.

	"cman_tool status" prints the multicast address too.

	Use slightly more RFC-compliant multicast address.

	Install the AIS keygen program.

2005-09-28  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	move shrink and statfs_sync from ioctl to sysfs

	handle sysfs dirs for both gfs1 and gfs2

	update to work with new sysfs organization (doesn't work for gfs1 yet)

	add \n

	missed the sys_fs_uninit at unmount

2005-09-27  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	add a couple basic sysfs attributes

2005-09-27  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	gfs2 was unable to truncate files if they were opened with write permissions, but the process later changed uids to an uid that didn't have write permission. POSIX says that if you had the permissions when you opened the file, you don't loose them when you change uids.
	gfs2 no longer checks permissions before truncating a file in gfs2_setattr.  I
	don't know what this check was ever added (It didn't exist in gfs 6.0). Since I
	don't know why the check was added, I can't say for certain that it is
	unessential.  However, I can't see any reason to do it, so I deleted it.

2005-09-27  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	The fs kobject is now passed into the lock module at mount time. It's ignored by nolock and gulm. Kobject added to gfs1 so the same lock module can operate with both gfs1 and gfs2.

	Pass the kobject for the fs into lm_mount() so the lock module's kobject can appear below it in sysfs.

2005-09-27  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	rename "commskey" to "keyfile" as that's slightly better. remove redundant entry

	Don't overwrite AIS node addresses just because a nodeid matches Keep nodes in ID order

2005-09-26  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix usage message

2005-09-23  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Tidy multicast code and use a suitable (ip4 or 6) default if none is specified.

	Allow CCS version to go forward between cman_tool join & startup, but not backward. Don't put an incarnation number on a node newly arrived from CCS.

	Add uS to the log timestamp

	Updating ccs_tool's editconf commands for new cman schema (note: the old schema will still work [nodeids permitting] but the new one is slightly simplified)

2005-09-22  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	add watchdog.o to the rgmanager object files, to fix undefined reference to watchdog_init.

	switched 'deamon' to 'daemon' in uninstall rule.

2005-09-22  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Cope with node names in CCS that we can't resolve (provided they have a node ID) and warn if odd things happen.

2005-09-21  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	move a bunch of stuff from ioctl to sysfs

	minor fixups

2005-09-21  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Don't try and do floating point maths in the preprocessor.

	Use a temp variable for the node address, to avoid potential alignment problems.

	new AIS version

	byteswap the header too

	Need to return earlier if the socket failed to connect.

	Refresh cluster FD before each select.

	If any of the queues have cached message in then return an fd for /dev/zero from cman_get_fd() - that way it will be guaranteed to be active for read so we will get called back to flush those queues.
	Also, use the new GETNODECOUNT call to get the nodecount rather than getting the
	whole node list.

	Missing comma & comment.

2005-09-20  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Updated patch that works rather better.

2005-09-19  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Patch for clvmd so that it can be used with libcman. With a dynamic libcman, the same clvmd should be able to run with a kernel or userland cmand depending on the library installed.
	When libcman is packaged I will apply this to the main clvmd sources

	Add CMAN_REASON_PORTOPENED callback reason.

2005-09-16  Stanko Kupcevic  <kupcevic@redhat.com>

2005-09-16  Stanko Kupcevic  <kupcevic@redhat.com>

	Added watchdog that reboots if clurgmgrd crashes

2005-09-15  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Use ccs as the repository of config & node information (that is, after all, why it is there!) rather than passing it around in extraneous cluster messages.
	This also has the effect that we can re-read CCS if a node joins the cluster with
	a higher config version than us, making "cman_tool version" redundant. That
	should please some people.

2005-09-14  A. J. Lewis  <alewis@redhat.com>

	Initial commit of fsck for GFS2  o this is based on the fsck for GFS1 with changes to handle the ondisk    format changes introduced in GFS2  o This is a work in progress - it will not throw errors on a clean    filesystem, but it has not been extensively tested yet, so be careful.

2005-09-14  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Strip down barriers so they use the VS features of AIS.

2005-09-14  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	fixed acl code so that acls are displayed when enabled, and not displayed when disabled.  Also cleaned up the intenting of my last checkin.

	When you copy an suid root file to gfs, you start a transaction on the write and then make a vfs call that eventaully tries to start another transaction for changing the file attributes.  This cause gfs to print a warning and not get the attributes right.
	After this change, if you already have a transaction started in
	gfs2_setattr_simple, instead of failing the warning assert, you simply use
	the existing transaction.

2005-09-12  Stanko Kupcevic  <kupcevic@redhat.com>

	get rid of glock_hold/glock_put, use gfs2_glock_hold/put everywhere

	Don't reset atomic statistics counters to zero when they roll into negative numbers, just cast to unsigned.  AFAICT 'gfs2_tool counters' shouldn't need any change.

	Pass all gfp flags to gfs2_holder_get() instead of having GFP_KERNEL added to what the caller provides.

	Replace TRUE/FALSE with 1/0.  This is a really unfortunate blow to code comprehension but kernel lords are always right.

	slim down the printk's in assertions

	small Makefile fixes

	library commits that go with the last lot. I'm not sure why CVS missed them out.

	Build cman against openAIS's libtotem_pg. This is still pretty unstable stuff so be warned.
	For the moment it downloads a prepackaged/patched version of openais from
	my web site. This /will/ change.

	There's still a lot of work to do on this code but is basically works with a few
	caveats:

	1. Barriers are completely untested and may not work at all.
	2. Don't start several nodes up at the same time, they might get the same
	   node ID(!) unless you used static node IDs
	3. Some of the info returned by cman_tool is wrong.
	4. The exec path for cmand is hard coded (in the Makefile) to ../daemon/cmand
	   so you must currently always run cman_tool from the dev directory unless
	   you change it.

2005-08-10  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	get rid of fixed_div64.h -- the existing do_div() works fine in my tests, and do_mod() isn't needed since do_div() returns the modulus.

	Use wait_event() in do_lock_wait() instead of managing the waitqueue ourselves.  I have some doubt that the log spinlock really needs to be held while testing the atomic counter, but I'm not certain enough to drop it.

	- s/uint32_t/sector_t for get_region_size return

	- Fix cmirror bugs
	- Only allow one machine to perform resync work
	  There must be a race in there somewhere when allowing multiple
	  simultaneous recoveries...  This side-steps that issue.  Besides
	  one machine moving the heads is probably better than all.

	- when a resync is done, we must mark it in the clean list as well
	  as the sync list.  Otherwise, the log will always tell us there
	  is recovery to be done - even if there isn't.

	- Only suspend the server on cluster events - not dm suspends.  If

	- fix typo

	- clean up logging

	- take the code that connects to cman out of the init function and
	  do it on first mirror activation.  This way, you don't have to
	  have cman running in order to load the module...  Makes mirror
	  activation a bit slower, but speeds up module loading.

	fix for bz 161352
	Adds support for latest ilo firmware version (1.75).  Changes were also
	added to make sure that power status of the machine is being properlly
	checked after power change commands have been issued.  Before, it was
	assumed to work through the messages recieved in the xml response.  As a
	result, systems with APCI  enabled would soft power off leaving, systems
	running instead of properlly fencing them.

	A new option, ribcl,  was added to the agent to force the protocol to use
	when trying to send the power off command.  Setting this value to "2.21"
	might be required to work around some versions of ilo on machines with APCI
	enabled.  If left blank, the protocol version is autodetected.

	need to copy the rsb's hash into the remove message

	Per-lockspace option for dlm to run without using a resource directory. What would be the directory node for a resource, is statically assigned to be the master node instead. - no directory lookups are done which speeds up most new requests - the first node to lock a resource is now unlikely to be the master   for it, slowing down other cases - combined with directory weights, the dlm can be configured to run   as a "lock server" where the lock master has a weight of 1 and   all others have a weight of 0

2005-06-15  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- fix for bug 157094
	A mysterious error being generated when trying to do a broadcast (sendto):
	ccsd[1704]: Unable to perform sendto: Cannot assign requested address

	On certain clusters (seems to be when ccs tries using IPv6), this error
	could show up 9 out of 10 times.  When the error was received, the
	broadcast attempt would fail.  This caused the attempt to grab any
	possibly updated cluster.conf files to abort.

	Waiting a moment, closing the socket, reopening the socket, and retrying
	the broadcast seems to solve the issue.  (It has work 100+ times so far.)

	I'm not entirely certain what is causing the initial try to fail - perhaps
	the underlying subsystem is not quite ready...  In any case, I have never
	seen a second attempt fail.

By default a node has a weight 1. All nodes with weight 1 is the standard old behavior.  If all nodes have weight 0, all revert to weight 1.

	adjust some log_error() messages and open syslog when daemonized

	Add two comments in set_master() explaining how things work.

	When an outstanding lookup is re-processed after recovery, the MASTER_WAIT flag needs to be cleared first or the lkb will be made to wait on the rsb's lookup list, i.e. waiting for itself.  Also add a FIXME comment describing a related recovery scenario we don't yet handle correctly.

	All lookups outstanding when recovery happens need to be resent after recovery.  The RESEND flag was not being set on these lkb's, through, so the lookups were never being resent.

	Changes to the way the local build works:

	accidently using files that are locally installed on the system (instead
	of the files in CVS).

	This should also make it easier for external people to build from HEAD.

	o  Changed the lookup so it doesn't need to take the new inode's glock.    This simplifies it a lot. o  Other cleanup.

	Fix BZ158133. Fix an oops that occurs when an acl is set that consists of nothing but a header.

	remove the timeout in wait_function which was for debugging, and don't print all rsb's when clearing the recover_list

	dlm_recover_members_wait() and dlm_recover_directory_wait() moved to recover.c; wait_status functions are now static

	Wait until all locks are recovered before doing lvb recovery. This simplifies the process and doesn't waste time running the lvb recovery routine multiple times on some rsb's.

	Address numbers start at 1

	Add options to cman_dispatch() so that callers can filter out non-interesting messages. These will be saved on a list and sent when the user is again interested in them.

	don't wrap wait_event in an infinite loop and use a timer

	also return -EBUSY for convert if lkb_wait_type is non-zero

	put the '*' just to the left of the structure field

2005-04-27  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Fuzzy statfs(): When statfs() is called, the return value is the state of the whole filesystem was in sometime in the last X seconds plus any local changes. This algorithm is very similar to the way we do quotas.  X is a tunable parameter, statfs_quantum.  (The default is 60 seconds.)  A statfs() call now requires no network or disk I/O.

	Fix one of the big fixme's: immediately after finding the lkb in dlm_lock() and dlm_unlock() we were checking and filling in the lkb's fields all without the rsb locked.  We now pass the necessary input args down to the next stage so they can be safely saved in the lkb after the rsb is locked.

	use long to save pointer val

	pack_rcom_lock/receive_rcom_lock_args was missing lkb_status and astaddr's

	use prefered inline

	Improve logic that delays and reduces fencing.  When fenced is recovering for a failed node, the 'post_fail_delay' is used to give victims some time to rejoin the cluster and avoid being fenced.  If this happens once, then it's likely to happen again and the 'post_join_delay' is more appropriate, so fenced switches to the 'post_join_delay' value (if it's larger which is usually the case.)
	The common situation where this helps is when multiple nodes fail causing
	the cluster to lose quorum and then the failed nodes all rejoin the
	cluster at about the same time.  The rejoining nodes are more likely
	to all avoid being fenced if fenced uses the larger post_join_delay.

If it can't it will use the gnbd name as the unique id.  It is possible to override this with -u.  gnbd_import can get the unique id of a device it has with the -d option.

2005-03-11  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Add a new "flags" parameter to lm_mount() of the lock module interface. When the flag LM_MFLAG_SPECTATOR flag is passed in to the lock module, GFS is asking to join the filesystem's lockspace, but it doesn't want to modify the filesystem.  The lock module shouldn't assign a journal to the FS mount.  It shouldn't send recovery callbacks to the FS mount.  If the node dies or withdraws, all locks can be wipped immediately.
	If the lock module doesn't implement the flag, GFS will work as expected
	except that the mount will reserve a journal it will never use.

	Add and implement a "spectator" mount option to GFS to take advantage
	of the spectator mount flag.  When the mount option is used, the FS
	looks just like a RO filesystem.  The difference is you can have lots and
	lots of them.

	When gfs does an lm_cancel() we need to do a dlm cancel if that's where the lock is blocked.  We were doing nothing.  Changes also to deal correctly with the ast result from a dlm cancel and the potential for a cancel to return an error.

	Fix problems with cancelation.  We weren't dealing with waiting locks being canceled, and we weren't sending back an adequate result for a remote unlock to deal with a cancel.

	Fixed 146672.  While it is still possible to see this bug,  the problem that I saw every time it happened to me was that the process in gfs_log_dump() got starved waiting for the sd_log_lock semaphore. This fix changes sd_log_lock into a rw_semaphore, and uses down_write and up_write instead of down and up. read write semaphores are totally fair, so gfs_log_dump() can't get starved

2005-02-23  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Add -t option to join/leave/wait, specifies the maximum amount of time that the operation will wait before giving up (waiting that is). Also cman_tool join -w will retry if it fails ENOTCONN (ie the node did not join a cluster). See the man page for some wrinkles.

	Put some locking round membership_task so we don't try to wake up a process that has gone away.

2005-02-23  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	When locks on the convert queue are granted, we need to try again to grant locks from the beginning of the convert queue.  Locks at the beginning may not be grantable because of locks at the end.  But, granting locks at the end (permitted when using the NOORDER flag) may make earlier locks grantable.  Specifically, we have the following situation when running "gfs_tool freeze" in parallel on three machines:
	Granted 1 PR

	        3 PR->CW

	* nodeid 1 converts PR->CW
	  granted mode is demoted to avoid conversion deadlock

	Granted
	Convert 1 NL->CW
	        2 NL->CW
	        3 PR->CW

	* conversions for 1 and 2 are blocked by 3's PR
	* conversion for 3 is granted

	Granted 3 CW
	Convert 1 NL->CW
	        2 NL->CW

2005-02-21  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	I was trying to be too economical with code in cman_tool wait, ISQUORATE & GETMEMBERS can't really be conflated like that because they return different sorts of things.

2005-02-21  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	If a local client logged into gulm, and the client got the nodelist before the local gulm connected to a Master gulm, the local client would not get updates when the full list was received. This fixes that.

2005-02-17  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Deal with failed joinconf more sensibly. (that message may have to go though) Quick-quit out of the read/dispatch loop if a node goes down so we can process it in a timely manner.

2005-02-17  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	remove some non-critical printk's

	Make dlm_recoverd thread a permanent fixure of each lockspace. The wake_up oopses I get when they're dynamic get in the way of other tests.  This is already in the RHEL4 branch.

2005-02-16  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	This fixes the socket leak in the case where a primary connection was closed due to EOF on the socket, the secondary did not get closed.

2005-02-16  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	We were ignoring blocking callbacks for locks being converted which caused us to skip some that were necessary. Fixes bz 147798 (along with similar dlm fix)

	Blocking asts were being ignored for all locks being converted which resulted in some necessary basts being skipped.  In particular, after a failed NOQUEUE conversion, gfs could be left holding a lock and getting no callback for it while others were left waiting.
	This changes things so that a bast message is ignored if the lock is
	being converted and NOQUEUE isn't set, or if the locks is being
	unlocked.  Fixes bz 147798.

	We add NL locks to a resource to implement gfs's hold_lvb().  When we request these NL locks, use the EXPEDITE flag so the NL request will be granted immediately.

	When a conversion request has been sent to a remote master, that remote master fails, and the sender becomes the new master of the resource, the requested lkb needs to be moved from the converting queue back to the granted queue prior to processing the conversion request locally.
	Previously, we were leaving the lkb on the converting queue.  The
	specific problem I observed from this happened when the conversion
	was NOQUEUE and returned -EAGAIN.  When an unlock for the lkb
	happened later on, dlm_unlock would find an incorrect status in the
	lkb of CONVERTING, return an error and trigger an assertion failure.

	don't do a dlm_lock_dump when an assertion fails

	cman_tool now picks as the local nodename whatever name has been entered for the local node in cluster.conf.  If the node is represented in cluster.conf by a FQDN, then that's the nodename it will have.  If the node is represented in cluster.conf by a hostname without domain, then that's the nodename that it will have.  This should fix bz 146320.
	(As always, the network interface associated with the nodename is the one
	cman will use.)

2005-02-11  Chris Feist  <cfeist@redhat.com>

	Merged changes from RHEL4 branch to fix building if not installing.

2005-02-10  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	man page for cman_tool leave -w

	Add a -w (wait) option to "cman_tool leave". If the cluster is in transition then the leave ioctl returns -EBUSY which causes the leave operation to fail.
	If you add -w to the command-line then cman_tool will wait and retry the
	operation until it either gets a proper error or the leave completes
	sucessfully.

	This is probably what's really needed by the shutdown script.

2005-02-10  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Clean up changes from last commit related to bz 143487. fence_node -O <nodename>  is used to force a ccs connection, and a clustername arg is not used.

2005-02-09  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- fence_node has been change to work better with gulm (143487) - Two new options have been added   -c <cluster_name>   -O
	The -O overrides the quorum requirement.  It requires the use of -c,
	due to the fact that CCS may be in a transitional phase that only
	solidifies when the cluster is quorate.

	Although I haven't tested it, this may allow a person to
	fence_node -O -c someone_else_cluster someone_else_node... a
	feature? a bug?

2005-02-09  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	Removed a bunch of unused global vars. (well, externs to atleast)
	Fixed bug 147602 - gulm doesn't allow 5 servers
	silly me, ment <=5 not <5.

2005-02-09  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	fixed journal corruption mentioned in bug 146672. If the latest entry written to the log before a crash was the at the segment before the last dump entry, the last dump entry would be overwritten on journal replay. Changed the checks in check_seg_usage to avoid this.

2005-02-09  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Be a bit smarter about when to schedule() when reading lots of data (usually during recovery)

2005-02-09  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	remove unused "bulk lookup" function

	Similar bug to the one fixed the other day.  If recovery is aborted during rebuild_rsbs_send(), some rsb's could be left on the recover_list.  This triggers the recently added assertion during the next recovery cycle.   We now clear the recover_list if rebuild_rsbs_send() is aborted.

	- exit with an error if an invalid votes value is found - fix error in the votes value check in the two-node case. we were   exiting with an error when no votes value was specified instead   of accepting that the default of 1 is correct

2005-02-08  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	- liblvm2clusterlock.so has moved from /lib to /usr/lib so we need:   LVM2/scripts/clvmd_fix_conf.sh /usr/lib
	- no longer need manual devmap_mknod.sh for DM

	- remove info on cman using mulitple interfaces on multihomed nodes
	  since it's out for now

	remove three log_debug lines that are called so frequently during recovery that they blow away other interesting messages in the debug log

2005-02-08  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	fix #146924

2005-02-08  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	In rcom_send_message, return an error from midcomms_send_message instead of panicking.  Returning an error from both functions is valid when nodes fail during recovery.  Also switch some log_error to log_debug so they don't go to the console.

2005-02-07  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Include rg name in clustat -x output

2005-02-07  A. J. Lewis  <alewis@redhat.com>

	Large batch of changes - mainly dealing with ExHash directory handling.
	 o Fix a spot where a pointer not getting set to NULL would segfault later
	 o Fix entry checking - large number of changes - still some issues
	 o Make exhash leaf entry removal work correctly
	 o If we find a bad .. entry in pass3, relink it to the treewalk parent
	 o Mark exhash directories with bad height or depth invalid
	 o Correctly create directories and handle dirs with height > 0
	 o Track leaf pointer counts and error directories they don't match depth

	use $(CC) for linking. don't install header executable

2005-02-07  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	remove utils_srt.c

	- Assert that the recover_list is empty at the start of dlm_dir_clear.   If there's anything incorrectly left on that list from a previous   aborted recovery, we'll find it here and not with an odd oops later.
	- Change log_debug() for normal locking operations to log_debug1() where
	  DLM_DEBUG1 isn't set by default.  This way abnormal or infrequent
	  conditions from log_debug() aren't quickly blown away.

	- Don't call dlm_locks_dump() when DLM_ASSERT fails.

	- In rcom_send_message(), only test/clear the READY flag when doing a
	  synchronous request.  It's not used for async requests and because
	  these async requests can be called from different threads it could
	  lead to incorrect assertion failures.

	- In rcom_send_message() get rid of the RECCOMM_WAIT flag which was
	  only used as a sanity check.  Given that rcom_send_message can be
	  called from multiple threads and only synchronous calls are serialized,
	  an async caller could change the flag for the sync request and cause
	  the reply message to be discarded.

	If recovery was aborted during restbl_rsb_update(), some rsb's could be left on the recover_list.  This would cause an oops later when the next recovery sequence used the recover_list.  Now we clear that list if we abort the recovery.
	It seems unlikely people have seen this since it requires a node to fail
	at just the right time while other nodes are doing recovery.

2005-02-03  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	Partial workthrough of log messages.  Some moving, some changing. mostly changed `errors' that gulm can handle to not use log_err
	Some corrections to the estimated lock space size calculation.
	Still needs more work, but its closer.  Once this gets more accurate
	will use it for th highwater mark instead of lock count. But not yet.

	Added out going queues to the local connect in LTPX. Fixes bug 146670.
	Might need to add read penalties, but works for me without, so holding
	off on that.

	Removed a util_* that hasn't been used in quite some time, but was
	still being compiled and linked in.

2005-02-03  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Check quit_threads in a few more places so we don't get blocked when trying to leave the cluster.

	 o Remove a number of unused macros  o Make version strings conform to the standard; update usage string

	Out with the old, in with the new.

	Fix a bug in a memset().

	Change diaper so it doesn't return errors if the filesystem is already shutdown.  This makes things a lot quieter.

	Don't complain about uninit()ing busy log buffers if we're shutdown.

	Don't complain if we stall trying to make a log reservation.

2005-01-27  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	There are a couple of potential problems this should fix related to an overlap of dlm_recoverd in ls_nodes_reconfig (changing the ls_nodes list) for recovery event N and dlm_recvd in dlm_dir_rebuild_send (reading ls_nodes list) for recovery event N-1.
	We now wait, in dlm_ls_stop(), for dlm_recoverd to detect and abort
	recovery event N-1.  This ensures that when all nodes receive
	dlm_ls_start() and begin recovery event N, that no other nodes are
	still working on recovery event N-1 in any way.

	There's still the chance that a stray/delayed message (in particular a
	RECOVERNAMES request) pertaining to event N-1 will be delivered while all
	nodes are working on event N.  There's an added check that should
	prevent this from causing any trouble for all practical purposes.

	One other possible problem is dlm_ls_stop clearing the status bits right
	before ls_nodes_reconfig sets them.  Doing this after dlm_recoverd
	is suspended makes it safe.

	I don't know which, if any, of these potential problems have actually
	been observed; none of them are very likely.  But, I think there's
	a fair chance that the first problem matches bz 145831.

2005-01-07  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	IF YOU USE CCS, YOU WILL WANT TO READ THIS:
	There have been changes to ccs_get.
	ccs_get use to operate as follows:
	- A query that resulted in a single match would return that match
	  every time.
	- A query that resulted in multiple matches would iterate over the
	  matches given subsequent calls, terminating with null, and then
	  continuing from the beginning.

	This made things very hard if you were expecting a list but there
	was only one match.  You ended up waiting for a 'null' that never
	happened.

	ccs_get now operates as follows:
	- Subsequent queries of the same request will simply interate
	  repetitively over the matches - never returning null.

	A new function has been added, 'ccs_get_list'.  It takes the same
	arguments as 'ccs_get', but operates as follows:
	- Subsequent queries of the same request will return the matched
	  items, followed by null, then repeat.

2005-01-07  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	I ran into some weird race with having gulm load info from ccsd more than once while ccsd was trying to figgure out if it was in a quorate cluster or not. Solution is not to ask ccsd for info more than once.

2005-01-06  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- fix for bug #137021 ccs doesn't find most recent cluster.conf
	This boiled down to a timing issue.  ccsd processes request serially (broadcast, or otherwise).

	When cman_tool was started, it issued a connect.  While not yet quorate, ccsd must broadcast to see if there are any more recent versions of the config file.  This happens as part of the connect.  select is used to set a timeout on just how long it waits for replies.

	2 problems were encountered.  1) the timeout was not being properly reset after the select returned.  2) everyone uses the same timeout

	What results is that if a connect is issued simultaneously on every node, they first try to process the connect - then any broadcast requests.  Because they all have the same timeout, they never recieve broadcast responses from their peers (because they are also stuck processing connects).

	The current solution is to add a random component to the timeout and make sure to set the timeout properly after the select returns.

2004-12-23  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	So here is a bit of code that finishes up the withdraw support for gulm.  It abuses the way callbacks on locks work to give something that can alert other mounters that a journal needs replaying. It works.  I don't like it.  It feels kludgy.  I am going to see if I can come up with something beter, but this at least will let people play with withdraw in a cluster.

	moved a message from Always to locking.

2004-12-23  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- add ccs_tool to Makefile
	This will likely switch from a script to a C-program soon, as functionality
	is added.

2004-12-23  Adam Manthei  <amanthei@redhat.com>

	Jon changed the verbosity of ccsd.  -v doesn't need to be on by default anymore.

2004-12-23  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- remove log_msg_always - make log_msg always print - remove -v option
	I was making the mistake of thinking that the user should control the
	daemons output by using (or not using) -v.  However, the more correct
	way is to print everything to the log and let the user sort through
	it by defining syslog preferences.

2004-12-22  Adam Manthei  <amanthei@redhat.com>

	make the daemon more verbose in the script since the default logging is not very helpfull.

2004-12-22  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	updated the patch for last lock_gulm.ko commit.

	Most of the witdraw code.  Still lacking a bit to notify other mounters that the withdrawn journal needs replaying.  But at least people can start playing with the withdraw and not assert.

	code to allow expiration of a subset of locks.  This will be used by the witdraw code.

2004-12-22  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Make MAX_RETRIES /proc settable. Make some KILL messages reliable.

	Don't hold the res_lock for quite so long. Well, it works for Daniel McNeil.

2004-12-22  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Fixed a reference leak of lock module in-use counts that was caused by filesystems withdrawing.

	Fix a case where the resource index isn't propery released on error.

2004-12-21  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- fix bug 128662, ccs_test connect <clustername>: connects to local   ccsd regardless
	  There was a remaining end case with this bug.  A machine could
	  broadcast, forcing all other nodes to load their config files.
	  So, if you wanted a different config file on another machine
	  (besides what was local at the time of the broadcast), you
	  would have to kill and restart ccsd.  This is no-longer
	  necessary.

	- fix bug: 128422 (ccsd grabs network config silently if local is bad)
	  Now, if the local config file is bad, ccsd errors out - giving the
	  user the output from the parser as well as the steps to take to
	  fix the problem.

2004-12-21  Adam Manthei  <amanthei@redhat.com>

	remove /dev/misc/dlm-control if the major/minor number of the device node conflist with the kernel assignments as reported by /proc/msic.

	Be a lot quieter on the console

	If a transition gets usurped by another node, always tidy up old joining nodes. Also, prevent a CHECK transition from usurping a real one as that's just a waste of everyone's time.

2004-12-20  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- minor updates to ccs_tool

2004-12-18  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Add code to implement "gfs_tool withdraw /mountpoint".

	o  Add facility to stop all block I/O from a filesystem by setting a    bit.  The number of outstanding I/O is also kept track of, so it's    possible to wait until all in-flight I/O has finished. o  Used this new code to allow GFS to abort a filesystem at arbitrary    points in time.  GFS sets the bits to stop I/O, waits for all    in-flight I/O to stop, and then calls a new lock module function,    lm_withdraw, to ask the lock module to leave the lockspace.    (Basically, perform all recovery steps for the filesystem except    fencing.) o  Switch the places that see unrecoverable I/O errors or filesystem    consistency problems to withdraw from the cluster instead of    panicking. o  Get rid of most of the assert calls that panic the system in favor    of printing warnings or withdrawing from the cluster.  There is    still some ongoing work that needs to be done.  Mostly in the area    of making sure that resources are freed appropriately in error cases    that (now) don't panic the machine. o  At the moment, it's usually possible to cleanly unmount the    filesystem after it has withdrawn itself from the cluster.  There    are still some cases where the filesystem is unmountable or the    withdraw causes oopses.  These are bugs that can and will be fixed. o  The lm_withdraw() functions for lock_gulm and lock_dlm still need    to be written.  Right now they just panic the machine.  :-)

	  This was causing connect failures, version rollbacks, etc.

	- fix a problem with ccs_tool update which was causing a connection

	src/daemons/Makefile: Remove debugging compiler flag

	- include/resgroup.h: Remove unnecessary states/requests.  Add handle_start_remote_req, rg_doall,  and svc_status protos.  Add FORWARD define for when a request can be carried out - just not locally. - include/reslist.h: Add protos for res_condstop/res_condstart and resource_delta/resource_tree_delta functions - src/clulib/rg_string.c: Change to match states/requests in resgroup.h - src/daemons/groups.c: Don't even bother evaluating disabled resource groups.  Handle CONDSTOP and CONDSTART requests in the script exec path for changed resources.  Handle online resource and group configuration changes (e.g. after a SIGHUP).  Add rg_doall for queueing an event on all resource groups and optionally waiting for completion. - src/daemons/main.c: Handle SIGHUP - flag for reconfiguration.  Move status checks queueing in to the main loop (used to happen automatically from within rg_threads -- this caused problems with reconfiguration). - src/daemons/restree.c: Fix misc bug preventing resources without a recover function being treated as though they had a recover function. - src/daemons/rg_locks.c: Rename __ccs_mutex to _ccs_mutex so as not to upset glibc developers. - src/daemons/rg_state.c: Add svc_advise_stop to clean up _svc_stop function a bit.  Misc cleanups in the start/stop functions.  Move report of started RG into svc_start so it doesn't appear multiple times in different places (causing appearance of a RG being started twice on one node...).  Add svc_status function as part of rg_thread cleanup.  Return FORWARD from svc_stop/etc when we don't own the resource group. - src/daemons/rg_thread.c: Change thread model to have worker threads exit for a given RG instead of hanging around.  This greatly simplifies the code paths and reduces memory consumption when running mlocked. - src/utils/clustat.c: Change reporting of "no members" to "this node". Just because one node hasn't joined a SG doesn't mean others haven't.

	add sections on setting panic_on_oops and sources of more info

2004-12-11  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- Add message (that prints when -v flag is used with ccsd) that   reports when the cluster is quorate and will allow connections.
	- Change "cluster not quorate. refusing connection." back to
	  log_msg from log_err.  This is done since fenced will now
	  often query ccs before the cluster is quorate.  It is not
	  an error, it's just waiting for the cluster to become
	  quorate...

	- Fix a problem Dave was seeing.  If you do a ccs_test connect, before
	  starting ccsd, it will appear to stall indefinitely while doing retries.

	  The function in the ccs library responsible for talking to ccsd
	  must setup a connection from a privilaged port.  Sometimes, the
	  first port it tries to bind to may be in use, so it move on to
	  the next.  This is necessary.  However, I was not properly
	  checking the error return codes.  So, an ECONNREFUSED was being
	  interpretted as "Hey, try another port in a little bit."  Only,
	  after erroneously trying all the privilaged ports does it error
	  out - which is why it appears to stall indefinitely.

	- bug fix: remove premature optimization that breaks when  blocksize < chunksize - Add client in-flight retry on reconnect or failover - fix synchronizing bugs in kernel failover - Add a level of indirection to client vector so array compaction on   client disconnection works properly (Ben had a different fix for this) - agent: don't retry connect if server connection fails, wait for new server

2004-12-07  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	slight correction on how leave remove works

2004-12-06  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Got rid of some unused LM flags.

	Fix bug #141821.  KNFSD could call into GFS to do a lookup on ".." of the root directory.  GFS wasn't handling this correctly.

2004-12-06  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	minor update

	don't leave if gfs is mounted

	Re-order some initialization so that ccs errors will be caught and reported before fenced forks into the background.

2004-12-03  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	More excellent comments from ben.m.cahill@intel.com.

2004-12-03  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Don't send a KILL message if a node has the wrong generation number, try to work it out amicably with a CHECK transition instead.

	Add send/recv API to libcman, and some comments to libcman.h

2004-12-03  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	clean up join_ccs code

2004-12-03  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	D'oh.  Missed some files.

	o  Add "oopses_ok" mount option.  This allows GFS to oops instead of    panic on assertion failures.  This will hopefully allow easier debugging    in some situations.  But, using this option will make it possible    for a GFS oops on one machine to forever stall the filesystem on all    other machines in the cluster.  Use will *extreme* care. o  Start working utility functions to allow better error handling.

2004-12-02  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	added the stack overflow fix to head (rbz139863) gfs_glock_nq_m(), nq_m_sync(), and gfs_glock_nq_m_atime() no longer have arrays on the stack.

2004-12-02  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Declare the RO array in gfs_sort() staticly instead of dynamicly on the stack.  :-(

	Fix a spot where we weren't propagating away errors.

	Update.

2004-12-02  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Make sure transitionreason gets set if inherit mastership from a dead master node.

2004-12-02  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	add servicelist to man

	spell generation correctly in prints. add servicelist to usage() reoder lock stats.

2004-12-02  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	- update cluster startup tips, including new fenced delay/options - include cluster.conf update procedure from a linux-cluster mail

	add fence_tool

	Add an msleep(500) to dlm_recoverd in an attempt to avoid the same invalid wakeup we've seen before.

	add fence_tool man page

	A bunch of improvements: - Wait for the cluster to be quorate before starting or killing fenced.   Waiting here lets the join/leave be cancelled easily (not the case   if it blocks in SM). - Unfence ourselves before joining the fence domain.  Can be skipped   with -S. - Accept the c/j/f fenced options and pass them on to fenced when we   exec it (since fence_tool is the usual way of starting fenced.) - Get rid of -t timeout option which isn't useful now that we have   the c/j/f options for fenced.

	ignore the S option that fence_tool uses and may be inherited with the other args

2004-12-01  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Tidy up the node_id assigning code. With the changes made a while ago, a lot of this has become redundant and has been replaced with something much smaller and tidier. With luck it'll work too.

2004-12-01  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	DEBUG2 should be off by default

	Use sequence numbers to restore the most recent lvb copy during recovery when none of the locks have a definitive copy.

	ccs request began //nodes/ instead of //cluster/nodes/ Both work but the later is consistent with the other uses.

	missed clearing VALNOTVALID flag in unlock case

	Add -u option to unfence the node.  Does nothing if unfencing isn't supported by the agent.

	- add code to support unfence option - change default post-join-delay to 6 sec

	more helpful error message

2004-11-25  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- remove some print statements and refine todo list

2004-11-24  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	don't include old license dir

	munge usage wording

	Fix some problems in the recently added lvb and valnotvalid flag recovery.

	add content

	Update per recent changes and new preferred option: -n <nodename>

	While waiting for a manual ack, also check to see if the node has rejoined the cman cluster -- if it has, take that as an ack.  This new check is a no-op when using gulm.
	nodename="hostname" is now the preferred node-specific manual
	fencing data instead of ipaddr="hostname".  (The ipaddr form is still
	recognized.)

	Similarly, fence_manual -n <nodename> and fence_ack_manual -n <nodename>.
	(-s <ip> is still recognized for fence_ack_manual)

	(There has been some discussion about a possible new name for this agent,
	although fence_manual would remain an alias for any new name.)

	remove warning and a couple unnecessary type casts

2004-11-22  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- make the "in_sync" flag log based (rather than module-based) this   way, different mirror sets can have their own state of in-sync or   not.
	- fix bug that allowed different nodes to have different views of
	  who the master is.

2004-11-22  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	When updating the atime, don't demote the glock back to shared unless someone else is asking for it.

2004-11-22  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Make command-line options override CCS rather than the other way round. That really annoyed me.

	Remove some redundant code.

	Tweaks to init script

2004-11-22  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	The VALNOTVALID flag was being incorrectly cleared during recovery in cases where it was already set prior to recovery.

	The lvb wasn't being copied into the master-copy lkb on unlocks, so when the unlock entailed an lvb write, an old value was used. This solves the problem of gfs's cached stat values being wrong.

2004-11-20  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	If a nodes dies after beiung sent a JOINCONF then remove it from all nodes in the cluster, not just us.
	Might fix 133512

	Clean joining_nodeid in a few places. Also mark a joining nodeid dead before cancelling a transition.
	Should (probably) fix 139958

2004-11-19  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Allow delays of -1 to indicate forever.

	Three config options for fence deamon can be set in cluster.conf or on command line.  The "delay" option added earlier is replaced by "post_join_delay" and the default is 3s.  It's the length of time we would wait after adding a new node before fencing any victims (if there are any.)  This helps to avoid spurious fencing on cluster startup.
	"post_fail_delay" is the number of seconds we will wait before
	fencing a failed node.  This provides a chance for it to rejoin
	the cluster and avoid being fenced.  The default is 0s which is
	equivalent to past behavior.

	"clean_start" if 1 indicates that all nodes should be assumed in
	a clean state to start.  Any nodes in an unknown state when the
	fence domain is formed and enabled will not be fenced.  This can
	be dangerous to enable.  The default is 0.

	These can optionally be added to cluster.conf in the section
	<fence_daemon post_join_delay="x" ...>
	</fence_damon>

2004-11-19  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Many more good comments from ben.m.cahill@intel.com.

	if a plock IS_SETLKW, then it is a *blocking* request.

2004-11-18  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Change dead_node_lock to a spinlock and don't hold it for nearly as long. Don't cancel join if we get a WAIT after an ACK. This speeds up bulk rejoins quite a lot and also gets rid of some scary messages.
	Add a BUG() and printks that may help in tracking down 133512

2004-11-17  Chris Feist  <cfeist@redhat.com>

	Fixed problems w/ make uninstall not working w/ rgmanager.

	Uninstall script didn't uninstall gnbd.h properly.

	The compiler is generally better at knowing when to try to inline functions than I am.  And it gets confused when I am wrong.

2004-11-17  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Missed a use of the async flag that was just removed.

	o  Fix things so a freeze call requesting the transaction lock can't    cancel a recovery process requesting the transaction lock. o  All our lock modules are now asynchronous.  Get rid of support for    sync modules.

	Get rid of unneeded file.

2004-11-17  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix some comments

	Add a compatibility layer (conditionally compiled in) for using a 32bit libdlm on systems with a 64bit kernel.

2004-11-17  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Add more intelligence to fence daemon to avoid fencing nodes when we detect conditions where it might be likely.
	When fence victims are added following a node /joining/ the fence
	domain (rather than the usual of victims added following a node
	failing), it's a good clue that other nodes may be in the process
	of joining the cluster and therefore unfairly marked for fencing.

	When this is detected, delaying for a configurable number of seconds
	before doing the actual fence operation can allow victim nodes some
	time to join the cluster and avoid being fenced.  The default delay
	in this event is now at 3s, but increasing it to 10s may be better.

	It can optionally be set in cluster.conf by adding:

	<fence_daemon delay="10">
	</fenced_damon>

2004-11-17  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

2004-11-15  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Make the API a little more consistent. nodeid==0 always means (this node) and GETALLMEMBERS can be called witha NULL parameter to get the number of nodes.

	use GET_ALL_MEMBERS to return number of nodes in the cluster as it's consistent with the get_members call.

2004-11-15  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	We should wait for the fence domain join to complete before allowing a gfs mount, and not allow a mount if the node is in the domain but leaving.

	Bug in names_equal() caused nodes to never be identified as "first victims".  Now that this is fixed, people may start noticing their nodes being fenced when they're not in the cluster and a new fence domain is started.

	Add a flag to userland lockspaces that will cause them to be deleted when the last user closes the device.

	Get rid of suprious ASSERT in dlm_unlock that broke cancellations. Remove locking from a routine that is only ever called from ASSERT, it only causes the ASSERT to deadlock without producing any debug info :)

	Decrement the module count if returning -EEXIST from dlm_new_lockspace().

2004-11-10  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix refcounting error.

	Return the LVB "INVALID" state to users when the LVB has been invalidated.

	Fix my stupidity.

	o  Fix bug #135684.  Change code to make sure a RG is part of the "recent"    list before removing it from that list.  Thanks to    alexander.laamanen@tecnomen.com o  Other allocator cleanups.

2004-11-09  Chris Feist  <cfeist@redhat.com>

	Updated location of srpms.

2004-11-08  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Remember to assign parent during RSB rebuild.

	Tidied up the userland/kernel interface so that all the data transfer happens in the read/write path rather having some copy_*_user side-effects. Also tidy the dlm_*_wait() calls so they share code with the normal calls.
	This breaks kernel/userland compatibilty. You must upgrade both kernel and
	userland (libdlm) together!

	Move lowcomms_close() outside of the spinlock, as it may want to sleep.

2004-11-08  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Added spec file for fence

2004-11-04  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Set the VALBLK flag on the NL locks used for gfs's hold_lvb.  Not mixing lvb/non-lvb locks makes the recovery effects more sensible although no different in the end.

	Allocate an lvb for a new master rsb during recovery if any VALBLK locks exist, even NL.  This is a minor incremental change in lvb recovery.

2004-11-04  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	lowcomms_close can be called when atomic, so we can't use nodeid2con (which uses a semaphore). Get the connection directly instead. This should be safe because lowcomms_close is called during early recovery.

	Keep a local copy of cbinfo->isoob as cbinfo can be freed before reaching the while -- causing an oops.

	Add some locking around queue traversal.

2004-11-02  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Add a semaphore to serialize recovery with mount-group portion of unmount.  This avoids a potential hang during unmount where both the recovery and unmount threads believe the other will call kcl_start_done() to complete the recovery.  Unlikely this has been seen in practice, but possible.

	remove rcom debugging code that we're not using

2004-11-01  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	By default, gulm determins the name of the machine it is on with gethostbyname(). Then it looks up an ip from this name to use as its IP.
	There are now three ways to override these defaults.  --name will use the
	name given instead of what is in gethostbyname().  --ip will use that
	address for this machine. (don't be stupid and set it to a value that isn't
	configured to this machine.)  And --ifdev will lookup the ip from the
	configured network device.  --ip overrides --ifdev.

	These options are only available form the command line options.

	Fix __you_cannot_kmalloc_that_much by switching the large kmallocs to vmallocs.

2004-10-31  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Added kernel snapshot read lock upload for failover Added kernel worker daemon recovery for failover

2004-10-29  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	Allow gulm services to lock core.  Locked core will ignore the shutdown requests.  gulm services that lock core must logout to unlock core.  currently anything from kernel space locks core.

	Fixed an end case weirdism.  Given a cluster with three servers, and at least two clients.  Kill the Master, a Slave, and all but one client.  Wait for the remaining Slave to become Arbitrating, and completely fence all dead nodes.  After all killed nodes reboot, restart lock_gulmd as concurrently as possible.  The journals for the mounted clients will not get replyed.  The Problem.  The lock_gulmd on the Slaves log into the Arbitrator, Arbit becomes Master.  Lock_gulmd on killed Clients logs into Master before lock_gulmd on old Clients.  This makes the bit of info about the killed Clients being killed get lost.  So the old Clients do not see this when they return.  So they do not know that there are journals that need replaying.  Once the new Clients mount, they replay and things continue. If they do not mount, portions of the file system are blocked by expired locks.  The fix.  The current design of the cluster manager portion of gulm makes this overly complex.  Without changing the design, either a new daemon needs to be written, whoes purpose is simply to sweep the lockspace when nodes expire.  Looking for the locks with lvbs that are storing jid mappings and twisting them so that the module knows to replay them.  New daemon is icky, so not doing that.  Changing the design of gulm at this point is icky too.  Gulm is being maintained because it is a known code base.  Changing the design would break this.  So not doing that.  Since all that needs to be done is to fiddle one byte, given known values of other bytes in a lock, I just added a function to the lock server code.  A bit kludgy putting it there, but it is the least intrusive solution.

	and waiting for the filesystem to be unfrozen.  This bug has always
	been present, but it's much more visible in the 2.6 code.

	Note that the arguments to "gfs_tool [un]freeze" need to be exactly
	what's found in /proc/mounts now.

	Also, "gfs_tool margs <mountargs>" replaces the old way of specifying
	extra mount arguments: "echo <mountargs> > /proc/fs/gfs".

	Whitespace munging.

2004-10-27  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	* Pass SHAREDIR to build. * Support 'forbid' flag to prevent resource children.

2004-10-27  Chris Feist  <cfeist@redhat.com>

	Removing accidetally include defines.mk

	Added makefile

	Updated configure scripts to include a share directory (required by rg_mamanger)

2004-10-27  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	Fixed some queue jumping.  If the lock was held shared, and a new request for shared came along, the new request would succeed, even if there was another request in the conflict queues that came prior to it.

2004-10-27  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Removed.  Replaced by clusterfs.sh/netfs.sh

2004-10-27  Chris Feist  <cfeist@redhat.com>

	Fixed rgmanger build process

2004-10-27  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Add preliminary netfs (NFS) and clusterfs (e.g. GFS) resource agents. Add verify-all support to all file system agents.

2004-10-27  Chris Feist  <cfeist@redhat.com>

	Added make directory for rgmanager

	Changed the build process for rgmanager so it more closely resembles the other directories in cluster.

2004-10-27  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Stop compiler warnings.

2004-10-27  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- If a node remounts on the jid while we are replaying thier journal,   don't be mean and mark the jid as being free when we finish. - for real, remove the gulm_jid.h file.

2004-10-26  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- removed node locks.  The things they worked around in the past do   not need working around anymore. - remove gulm_jid.h works better if in gulm.h (not to mention some   bits were wrong.)

2004-10-26  Chris Feist  <cfeist@redhat.com>

	Updated version number

	Added a target to edit the release numbers when preparing tarballs.

2004-10-26  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- stop multiple local jid list scans on the same fs from trampling   each other.

2004-10-26  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	warning - large checkin.
	Change to using kernel_sendmsg & kvecs instead of sock_sendmsg & iovecs.
	This makes the code a lot neater in places and gets rid of some potential
	user/kernel address confusion.

	Oh, and it only works on 2.6.8 upwards.

2004-10-26  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Fix x86_64 build warnings

	Fix warning on x86_64

2004-10-26  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	A little optimization I've intended to do forever: get rid of the node list search in name_to_nodeid.  Add a nodeid array to just index into.

2004-10-26  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Add priority to cman sockets

2004-10-26  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Copy changes to old cman plugin.

	Fix bug feist was seeing during builds on x86_64

	Change to match magma API changes (clu_members_lost->memb_lost)

	Take out unnecessary printfs.  Change to match with new memb_lost/gained functions in magma.

	(1) Split up thread and non-thread libraries so applications which do not need pthreads can operate without linking against it. (2) Provide mutual exclusion/sleep hack around default-plugin's locking functions. (3) Change clu_members_lost/clu_members_gained to memb_lost/memb_gained to match up with other functions. (4) Add cp_connect function. (5) Add thread_test program for exercising multithreaded locking using magma's clu_lock/clu_unlock functions. (6) Clean up warnings in cluster_cmd

	Ensure we wait for the AST during the unlock as well as the lock.  Simplify when we assign/free the lksb in the lock function.

2004-10-25  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Make all the different libdlm targets use -fPIC during builds for proper symbol relocation on x86_64

2004-10-25  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- sometimes when starting multiple gulm server for the first time,   some may drop out due to GenID conflicts.  At times other than this   startup case, this is what we want.  But when we are just starting   up like this, we'd rather that the server give it another try.   So they do that now.

2004-10-25  Adam Manthei  <amanthei@redhat.com>

	bug 137035 -- add support for configurable ssl port locations to fence_ilo bug 137037 -- Add support for perl-Crypt-SSLeay package to fence_ilo

	man page for fence_bladecenter

	Yet another method for fencing the IBM bladecenter.  This method requires that the bladecenter is running with firmware new enough that provides a telnet interface to the management module.  This effectivley deprecates fence_xcat and is now the preferred fencing agent for the IBM bladecenter.

2004-10-25  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Per Patrick's comments: open/create lockspace when first lock is taken instead of at init time.

2004-10-25  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Remember to free connections[0] if initialisation fails.

	Don't deref freed skb. Thanks Ben.

	Close any created listening sockets "listen_for_all" fails

	Only wake astd when there is work for it to do. Also make the wake condition consistent with the check for work

2004-10-22  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Add cp_connect() function to library.  Make cptester only use cp_* functions.

	Use libdlm_lt with cman and sm plugins (removes dependency on dlm_pthread_*).  Also make all the return value semantics match.

2004-10-22  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- update the patch.

2004-10-22  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	removed unneeded variable

	Updated gnbd-kernel patches for 2.6.9

2004-10-22  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- Updated lcok_gulm for the 2.6.9 kernel.

2004-10-22  Chris Feist  <cfeist@redhat.com>

	Added cman-kernel patches for the new 2.6.9 kernel.

2004-10-22  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	update

	update from src files

	Change the default drop-locks value to 50,000.  Both the drop locks value and period are now configurable through proc.

2004-10-22  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Revert 1.40 as it causes astd to spin for some reason I haven't fathomed yet.

2004-10-22  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Update to the new plock lm interface and 2.6.9.  This fixes the problem where the dlm and vfs locks could get out of sync.

2004-10-22  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	Don't requeue front on conflict with priority flag. Else there is a race with multiple lock requests with priority flag that deadlocks request.

2004-10-22  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Update to 2.6.9.  (Lock_dlm and lock_gulm are broken until updated by their owners.)

2004-10-22  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Fix csnap_create so that csnap_destroy recovers dm devices on error Fiddle with command line arg order, really needs proper arg parsing

2004-10-21  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Add some (optional) stats collecting.

	Don't call wake_astd when we're doing a remote unlock.

	Add lock ORPHAN state, and associated query. Locks go into this state when they are marked PERSISTENT and the user process exits without unlocking.
	Thanks to Stanley Wang of Intel for most of this.

2004-10-21  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	mention how to use a different port for cman

	udp, not tcp

2004-10-20  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Update patch.

	Stuff all of the assert message into the panic call.

2004-10-20  Chris Feist  <cfeist@redhat.com>

	Removed a debug line from the Makefile, which is not necessary anymore

2004-10-20  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	We need to call process_requestqueue() when finishing a first recovery (upon joining the lockspace).  Although rare, it's possible to get dir lookups from other nodes prior to our own finish.  These need to be taken off the requestqueue and processed.  Hung gfs mounts are one evidence of this bug.

2004-10-19  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	Fixed gnbd_import and gnbd_export so that -r with no devices returns an error. This still needs to be fixed in the 6.0 code

2004-10-19  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- Added command to gulm_tool to query the services that have connected   to a given gulm_core.

2004-10-19  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Changed the protocol header to include the source port number so it can be passed to an application. I've moved things around in the header so if you try to use an old cman with this one they should just not see each other.
	Also widen the flags to an int32 so we don't havd to do that ugly shifting
	when checking them...it also keeps the structure aligned correctly.

2004-10-19  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	a "minimum gfs" howto that I wrote up a long time ago: one dedicated gnbd server and two gnbd clients as gfs nodes, haven't actually walked through and tested it, so...

	A slight variation on one of the recovery special cases wasn't handled correctly; add small fix and extend comment description.

	the journalid code inherited the hold_lvb changes for gfs; it's not necessary so skip

	update per build improvements by cfeist and anticipating a 2.6.9 kernel

2004-10-19  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Agents now instantiate servers using a dlm-based protocol

2004-10-19  Chris Feist  <cfeist@redhat.com>

	Misspelled the module_dir in the previous checkin.  (It was moduledir)

	Modified the 'make all' command to install the files into the cluster/build directory.  This allows one to do 'make all' and build everything w/o actually installing files somewhere on the system.

	Removed old includes from the kernel.  Added an include for ${incdir} in case inc dir is not /usr/include

2004-10-18  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Add a loopback to the comms layer so that clients can send messages to themselves or other clients on the same node.
	Note that, by default, broadcats sends will still /not/ be copied to the
	local system unless MSG_BCASTSELF is added to the flags.

	Compile two DLM libraries, one that needs pthreads, and one that doesn't

2004-10-15  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- i know they're unused, but it hurt my brain less if they're atleast   correct.

2004-10-15  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Add agent.c and sendagent.c

2004-10-15  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- fix for bug rbz134282 (bad handling of port number specification)

2004-10-15  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- stop printing out lock ids in different formats.  its confusing.

	Here's a patch to fix a gulm_tool bug that allows a user to enter the commands `gulm_tool nodelistcrap $server` and `gulm_tool nodeinfocrap $server $node`.   patch from adam manthei.

2004-10-14  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Sigh.  Get the gfs bits out of the patch

	Teach diff about dm-csnap.c and dm-csnap.h

2004-10-14  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	A simple DLM "hello world" example from Daniel.

	Improve support for PERSISTENT locks, and make the lkid checking a bit more paranoid.

2004-10-14  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- This removes the limit of 300 jid mappings.

	- get builds with --prefix working.

2004-10-13  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Don't align the glock hash buckets.  The gfs_sbd structure is now about 10 times smaller.

	Formatting.

	o  Fix bug #135249 with a lot of help from Dave Teigland.  Ever since the    create transaction was broken into two transactions, it was possible    for the second transaction to happen without having to allocate disk    space.  When this happened, GFS wasn't locking the resource index before    searching it.  Add the correct locking. o  Other munging.

2004-10-13  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	add DLM_SBF_VALNOTVALID so that the examples compile again. It's not implemented yet, but will be.

	Quick overview of the libdlm function calls.

	Dear, oh dear this was out of date. This should be a lot better but please report anything still amiss.

	Fix lock modes constants that were incorrect.

	Simple LVB test prog

2004-10-13  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	use simpler kthread routines for serviced

2004-10-13  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Open the default lockspace if dlm_get_fd() is called before any other locking operations. Make sure that any routines calling pthreads are surrounded by #ifdef _REENTRANT so a non-pthread library can still be built.

2004-10-13  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	fix dependency

2004-10-13  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- VFS does weird things with the error results, so before we try to   return a gulm error code, flip it to -1.   This fixes bz#132772

	- don't return positive error codes on loc module mount failures.   does not fix bz#132772

2004-10-12  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- plug leaky memory.

2004-10-12  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	I killed a bunch of people once.

2004-10-12  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Move pingtest into userspace and check for invalidated LVBs
	Also some cosmetic changes to the other tests that were lying around
	in this directory when I typed "cvs commit"

2004-10-12  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	another shot at correctly stopping dlm_recoverd thread when shutting down the lockspace, the kthread routines aren't much help in this situation

2004-10-12  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Don't free "othercon" connections when they are closed as they might still be busy in the read loop.

2004-10-11  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Handle default value in RA parameters

	Remove references to handlers for RAs.  They're not needed.

2004-10-11  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- don't logout on kill -TERM

2004-10-11  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Quit rx loop if the thread is closing down.

2004-10-11  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Avoid doing a synchronous unlock in unhold_lvb by just letting the lock_dlm thread delete the lock struct when the unlock completes. This prevents a possible deadlock between lock_dlm threads where one is doing recovery and the other is doing a gfs callback which can do an unhold_lvb.

2004-10-09  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	o  Support for immutable and append-only files with a lot of help from    Anton Nekhoroshikh <anton@hq.310.ru> o  Use intents to help with O_EXCL creates instead of the kludge we were    using before. o  Other cleanups.

2004-10-08  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	More doxygen stuff

2004-10-08  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Close the lowcomms sockets during recovery rather than as soon as cman notices the node has died. This should help synchronise things a bit better and (hopefully) avoid spurious disconnect/reconnect events that could happen.

	Forgot to set node_state when a node is killed via STARTTRANS

2004-10-07  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Print a message before, as well as after, trying to mount the lock protocol.

2004-10-07  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Add "manual" csnap server failover

2004-10-07  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Munging capitalization and other stuff.

2004-10-07  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- Initalize entire sockaddr6 for binding.

	- Fixed tiny memory leak in config parsing.

	- was double decrementing the expired holders counter.   stopped that.

2004-10-07  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Tidy the close_connection() routine. in addition add a parameter telling it whether to close an attched "othercon" or not as close_connection() is often called to shut down in the event of an error and we only want to close down "this" socket, not others that may be busy.

2004-10-07  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Updated design document with details on server failover

2004-10-06  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- the kernel side of things for getting the posix range F_GETLK cmd.

	- the kludging required server side to get something that posix can   use for the F_GETLK command.

	- try to be a bit clearer about how you can name thigns in the servers   list and what gulm does with that.

2004-10-06  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Remove out of date 2.4.26 kernel patch csnap-agent now accepts multiple local connections, with polling (and so multiple csnap devices on one node works again).

2004-10-06  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	sync up flags with dlm.h

2004-10-06  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	More comments from ben.m.cahill@intel.com.

2004-10-05  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	More comments

	Add Doxyfile.  Add lots of Doxygen-readable comments to code.

2004-10-05  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	A patch from ben.m.cahill@intel.com to install the gfs_mount man page.

	Fix a few bugs in the eattr/acl code. Other munging.

	Break compound assert into two.

	Munge.

	blerg.

	A command line tool that's a bit smarter about reading a GFS filesystem than gfs_edit is.

2004-10-05  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Update highest_nodeid at the client-end of a transition too. There is a tiny chance this could have been causing some memory corruption crashes.

	JOINING timeout should go back to JOINWAIT rather than giving up.

2004-10-04  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Remove MAX_MSG_SIZE limitation

2004-10-04  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Move development to 2.6.8.1 Replaced csnap-2.6.7 patch by csnap-2.6.8.1

	Renamed service.c to agent.c Added unlink for non-abstract named sockets Cleanups in dm-csnap.c client

2004-10-04  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- fiddled with a few comments. - make the dir that pid lock files go into now. - add name and ip to the cmdline arg help.

2004-10-04  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Though Id checked this in last week.
	Cope with sparsely allocated (and large) nodeIds. Gets rid of the
	"max_connections" config variable

2004-10-04  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	update from src files

	lock_dlm needs to return EAGAIN itself

	we must provide the correct astarg to dlm_unlock now that NULL is valid

2004-10-04  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Get rid of startup race by having csnap server fork its own daemon after successfully binding to port, instead of letting shell do it.

	Change to named socket for device control connection

2004-10-01  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	*sigh* :wq

	- fix inaccuracies in the counters.

2004-10-01  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Kernel check for max nodeid too. in case anyone bypasses cman_tool

2004-10-01  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Target now asks for connection when it needs one Service.c now looks more like a failover daemon The real devspam.c data checking utility checked in

2004-09-30  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	I am an idiot

	Honour the wanted_nodeid when we are the first node in the cluster.

	Don't say "we are leaving the cluster" when we never actually join it.

	Sanity check the nodeID

	Make sure the nodeids array is increased enough to cope with very large increments in the nodeid. I don't know why anyone would want to add a node id "1000" to a cluster with 10 nodes in it, but it shouldn't oops when you do :)

2004-09-30  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	always take the ast arg from dlm_unlock(), even when NULL

2004-09-30  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- must remember to decrement holder count when removing holders from   list.

2004-09-29  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- changes to match last change in userspace.

2004-09-29  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Now works with unmodified device mapper, hack removed

	Create virtual device by execing dmsetup Add example code for establishing connections

2004-09-28  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Socket-over-socket control interface now functional

2004-09-28  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Port from clumanager 1.2.x: potential fix for #114388

2004-09-28  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Wait for membershipd to shutdown before starting to clean up.
	This should ensure that the LEAVE message will get sent.

	Get rid of REMOTEMEMBER

	the kernel's interface numbers start at 1, not zero. So we need to increment "number" before passing it into cman.

	Remove state REMOTEMEMBER as it's not been used for ages. I've started the enum at 1 so that the other don't move though...
	Also cope better with dodgy networks during join. Send JOINREQ messages
	until we get a JOINACK or we timeout rather than just sulking.

2004-09-27  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- removed unused function.

2004-09-27  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Make /proc/cluster/status a bit more consistent in its output, and also show a little more when when not in a cluster.

2004-09-27  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- removed some code that wasn't called anymore. - added some static initializers.

2004-09-27  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Print "left cluster" reasons as text.

	Tidy daemon shutdown so that membership is always responsible for sending LEAVE messages and will only do them duting its shutdown.
	There are still a few send_leave() calls in other places but these
	are all just before a panic.

	Only stop recoverd if it is running

2004-09-25  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Actually commit (cvs, why are you so broken?)

2004-09-24  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- have magma use the new quorate info.

	- update the gulm lib to reflect new quorate info.

	- fixing an ism of gulm's gfs-only past.  There was not a way for   services on clients to truely know if the gulm servers were in   quorate or not.  So there is a new message that gets pushed out when   quorum is gained or lost.   this is related to bz #129879

2004-09-24  Daniel Phillips  <phillips@redhat.com>

	Added devspam.c device data verification utility Added socket-over-socket connection passing, not tested yet!

2004-09-24  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	use down_interruptible, fcntl may return EINTR

2004-09-23  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	First pass at resource tree deltas (tested).

2004-09-23  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- these build again. (forgot to update them with library.)

2004-09-23  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Free unused direntry structs when releasing a lockspace.

2004-09-23  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	An agent's error message should now be recorded in syslog (worked in my test).  Not sure why WIFEXITED didn't work as expected.

2004-09-22  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	fixed printing issue for 6.1

2004-09-22  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	Basic posix range locks work in gulm now.  Lots of changes required to the gulm lock module to get this working.
	In order to get the plock code in place, the main lock request
	pathways were rebuilt.  This made the code cleaner, as there were
	some pretty darn scary things going on before.  The down side to this
	is that I changed the lock pathways for everything.  The basics do
	seem to work though.

	Much of the non-working bits of the jid code were removed.  So we're
	still stuck at max cluster size of 300.  Will deal with this later.

	Through the course of this, I found some files with code I wasn't
	using. They got removed.

	Some code was moved around.  Some was pulled out of where it was
	randomly shoved originally, and put into its own file.

	There is most likely some other cleanup type things that can still
	be done.


	Mount/unmount on two nodes has been tested.
	~5 minute runs with make_panic has been tested.
	Couple of plocks can be grabed and released.
	There have been NO recovery tests done yet.

2004-09-22  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Add module ownership to various structures so we don't get unloaded whilst busy.
	Might fix bz 133142  but I want to do some more testing first.

	Fix bug in debugging routine. I hope we don't need it any more though...

	Use C99 initialisers. Also include module reference in file_ops.

2004-09-21  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	even though you now fence nodes by their cluster name, not their IP address, fence_gnbd still needed an 'ipaddr' parameter, and the man page still said that you should use hostname or IP address.  'ipaddr' is now deprecated, and a warning is printed when it's used.  The new parameter is 'nodename'.  The man page was also updated.

2004-09-21  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Make an assert be more verbose.

	Do better asserting in glock_hold().

2004-09-21  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Yet another one of those "I can't beleive we've not seen it before" bugs.
	When we close a connection lowcomms now removes any pending writes to
	that node from the writequeue too. I bet this has been responsible for
	some wierd behaviour in the past...

2004-09-21  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	change the way we check for local plock conflicts

2004-09-21  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

2004-09-20  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix that deadlock that's been there for ages but only ever pops its head up when you're looking for some other bug.

	Tidy.

2004-09-17  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Add (untested) SELinux support

	Be a bit more paranoid about creating the DLM device node. If it doesn't exist but the lockspace does, then look up the minor in /proc/misc and create it.

2004-09-17  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	get rid of "dir entry exists" messages

	add a couple syslog messages when nodes are fenced

2004-09-16  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- fix for bug rbz 132680
	When an update was issued, the new conf got written to all nodes, but the
	daemon did not pick it up in memory until a request was made.  So, if
	an additional update was done from another node before a request was
	made and it failed, the current in-memory (stale) version was rewritten
	to disk.

2004-09-15  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- remove unneeded print - add debugging line

2004-09-15  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- The first pass at getting range locking for gulm.  This is server changes   only.  So far the basics seem to work.  gulm should be implementing range   locks that are compatible to what posix range locks expect.  Gulm is lazy   about merging ranges though, but this shouldn't affect the usage any.

2004-09-15  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- fix make clean so it cleans up binaries in bin dirs - add pthread_detach to ccsd (cluster_mgr.c) - print select failure in ccsd if not EINTR

2004-09-15  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Add support for allocated node IDs, both on the command-line and from CCS

	Add support for assigned nodeids so that people can have permanent node IDs assigned in cluster.conf if they really want it.
	Also tidied the joinconf code so that the validation is in a seperate routine.
	Yes, I know I should have seperated these out into two commits. Sorry.

2004-09-15  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Put a lock around start and exit of dlm_recoverd thread. This should fix the oops I got waking a dlm_recoverd that wasn't there.

2004-09-14  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	there was a problem with running two gnbd_clusterd processes at the same time.  This fixes that problem.

	- added --use_ccs to --help

	- added --use_ccs to man page.

2004-09-14  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	This should be a fix for bug #126531.
	The issue has to do with the fact that GFS locking is only invoked by
	a mmap during the page fault.  There is no way for GFS to know that
	the process causing the page fault has finished reading or writing to
	the page for now.  The way GFS has worked in the past is that as soon
	as the page fault has completed, the lock protecting the file is
	available to be demoted or dropped at the request of a callback from
	another machine.  This means that a newly faulted-in page could get
	yanked out from under a process before it gets a chance to do
	sufficient work on the page.

	This checking provides a way for the page fault code to make a
	machine be greedy with a lock for a certain period of time.  This
	means that after the fault, GFS will ignore callbacks for a certain
	period of time.  After that time, GFS will respond to any callbacks
	that have arrived and then mark the file's lock as being able to be
	made greedy again.  The code is setup so that the amount of time that
	the lock is marked greedy is dependent on how much page faults traffic
	there is on that file.  When there is a lot of traffic, the time
	increases.  When there is a little traffic, the time decreases.

	Whitespace munging.

2004-09-13  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- fix memory leak + other minor anoyances

2004-09-13  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Zero out struct sockaddr_in6 structures before using...

2004-09-13  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- from the top, its lib/libgulm.a now. - clear out socket_in6 before using them.

	- from the top, its src/lock_gulmd and src/gulm_tool now.

	- moved the option parsing code to where it was a while ago.  I didn't make   any comments last time as why I moved it to where it was, so while I   imagin I had good reason, I cannot recall what ti was.  So putting it   back, but leaving crumbs just in case. - If you want gulm to get configs from ccs, you must pass the --use_ccs   option. The code that auto-detected ccs is broken, and I've got bigger   things to do for now.  I'll deal with this again later. - added some command line options to override the auto-detect for node name   and ip.  They're going to remain mostly undocumented for a while yet.

2004-09-13  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Remove MAX_MSG_SIZE limitation

2004-09-13  Adam Manthei  <amanthei@redhat.com>

	man page updates for the fence_rib and fence_ilo agents.

	adding the Net::SSLeay version of the fence_rib agent.  This should be used by those with iLO interfaces instead of the fence_rib (stunnel) version of the agent.

	Add ribcl version 2.0 support to fence_rib.
	Note that later versions of the iLO firmware may not work well with stunnel,
	Therefor it is better to use fence_ilo which uses the Net::SSLeay perl module
	instead.

2004-09-13  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- cleaned up the makefile as per aj req.

	 o allow CFLAGS to be added to from the command line

2004-09-13  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Allow a bit more flexibility in how nodes are specified in cluster.conf You can now use fully-qualified host names as well as abbreviated host names. If you do use FQDNs in there then uname must return the full name too OR you can override the hostname by using -n on the command-line.
	For cman, I recommend NOT using full hostnames in cluster.conf

	There is a small chance that rem_node could be NULL when passed into process_cnxman_message if people are doing silly join/leave test loops :)

2004-09-11  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- temporarily remove ccs from gulm.  Its way not working.  Need to figure   out why, but tired of people telling about it not working when I already   know.

2004-09-10  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Add a missing -Wall.

2004-09-10  A. J. Lewis  <alewis@redhat.com>

	 o CFLAGS+= instead of CFLAGS= so you can add options from the cmdline

2004-09-10  Adam Manthei  <amanthei@redhat.com>

	From Lazar Obradovic:
	this is a patch to allow fence_ibmblade to use udp port other than
	standard snmp (udp/161).

	Main reason for this is that IBM BladeCenter MM supports only 3 hosts
	and not hostgroups per community, and only 3 communities, which puts a
	limit to maximum of 9 nodes in a cluster.

	This is somewhat inconvinient, so, as a workaround, one can install a
	udp forwarder on some node(s) (preferably outside cluster) and use only
	its address in IBM BladeMM configuration. Port Forwarder will probably
	have to use some other port that standard snmp, not to block snmp access
	of "relay" node, so that's what this patch is all about.

2004-09-10  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Make sure we wake the membership thread before waiting for it to complete

	Make all node removal happen in remove_node(). This has the nice side effect that kernel listeners get notified of all nodes that ar removed :-)

2004-09-09  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- use safer naming for the dump files that go into /tmp.

2004-09-09  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Clear the use_count if shut down with "force"

	Free cluster ref if we fail to start.

	Don't get blinkered when in NEWCLUSTER modes...there may still be things out there!
	or, (in sensible language)

	Also send JOINREQ message when in NEWCLUSTER as well as STARTING states.

2004-09-08  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- found some stuff I forgot to remove.

2004-09-08  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Great comments from ben.m.cahill@intel.com.

2004-09-08  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- turned off a couple debugging things.

	- The first 'half' of range lock support for gulm.  Doesn't actually do   range locks, but all of the io for them should be there. - Adds support for finer grained uniqueness of lock holders.  Very easy to   use this to provide per process locks. (magma plug for gulm now does   this.) - Everything should work as before.  Only notable changes should be the   libgulm.h and output of dump files.

2004-09-08  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix a subtle bug in the node IDs code where a node could get a different node ID than last time if all the other members who knew about it before have also been down in the meantime.
	It also fixes a possible issue wherere nodes didn't have the same information
	about DEAD nodes, as only MEMBER nodes were propogared at join time.

	Now, MEMBER & DEAD nodes details are distributed so that the whole node view
	should be completely consistent across the cluster.

	Tweak the way NEWCLUSTER works in an attempt to prevent the splits that can happen if a new nodes all try to join/form a cluster at the time.
	Based on an idea by dct, this sends NEWCLUSTER messages out repeatedly
	after a time of patient watching and waiting. there then could be
	a tie-break based on the IP addresses.

	This is for bz #126991.

2004-09-08  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	- if a first start was aborted after getting past node setup, the   nodes would be left over for the subsequent start -- need to clear them - remove some unused code from nodes file and tidy clearing nodes list

	use kthread routines

2004-09-06  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Improve (I think) the usage message. Well, it's more verbose anyway.

	gfs needs a positive error from plock_get if there's a conflict

2004-09-06  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Change cman_tool kill to take a node name instead of a node number. This is more useful and more intuitive and more consistent.

	Rename "local_nodeid" so it doesn't clash with kernel's internal use.

2004-09-06  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

2004-09-03  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- this should get rid of the ENETUNREACH problems... as well as the   CONNREFUSED that AJ was seeing.
	The new 'struct sockaddr_storage' structure I was using was not being
	memset before being populated.  So, there were some extra fields at
	the end that were not right.  Specifically, strace showed:

	NORMAL (no failure):
	sendto(11, "\7\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 20, 0, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(50007), inet_pton(AF_INET6, "ff02::3:1", &sin6_addr), sin6_flowinfo=0, sin6_scope_id=0}, 28) = 20

	BAD (returns ENETUNREACH):
	sendto(10, "\7\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 20, 0, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(50007), inet_pton(AF_INET6, "ff02::3:1", &sin6_addr), sin6_flowinfo=34, sin6_scope_id=4144328704}, 28) = -1 ENETUNREACH (Network is unreachable)

	So, it appears that sin6_flowinfo and sin6_scope_id were crap.

2004-09-03  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	The -mm kernel that includes our flock patch.

2004-09-03  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	update from src files

	Changes to how dlm flags are used based on dlm changes. Change the way we deal with gfs's "hold_lvb" requirement: use a separate NL lock to represent a "held lvb" instead of replacing unlocks with conversions to NL.  This way unlocks from gfs are always handled consistently, with a corresponding dlm unlock.

	Change the lock granting logic to mirror the behavior of VMS.  The effect of QUECVT and EXPEDITE flags have also been changed to match VMS.  A couple new flags have been added to allow for non-vms-like behavior that's required when using range locks.

2004-09-03  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	o Fix the BLKGETSIZE64 ioctl for Linux 2.6. o Use lseek() to to determine the device size if BLKGETSIZE64 and   BLKGETSIZE fail.

	Get rid of a couple more 2TB checks.

2004-09-02  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- a couple minor updates to multicast code   - add a '-t' option for specifying ttl, default is still 1 (IPv4)   - use 224.0.2.5 (IPv4) and ff02::3:1 (IPv6) as default multicast addrs

2004-09-01  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- correctly specify the libdir in configure as /usr/lib - add IPv6 support to ccsd - add multicast support to ccsd - make the ccsd port numbers configurable - update ccsd man page - make the config file location tunable - make pid (lockfile) location tunable - still debating whether to turn on the option

2004-09-01  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Get rid of some pool crap. Get rid of an arbitrary 2TB limit that was there to keep 2.4 from screwing up.

	Ben Cahill's new man page.

	Update patches.

2004-08-30  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Fix build

	        * src/resources/*: Add status/monitor actions to metadata         * include/list.h: Update to fix compiler warnings.  This is not         complete; it's better to add a 'field' to structures requiring         list specs.         * src/clulib/vft.c: Remove unnecessary pthread locks.         * src/daemons/*: Misc. code cleanups.

2004-08-30  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Patches for a kernel that supports the new plock interface.

2004-08-27  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Rearrange some asserts.

	Munge.

	Reimplemented the flock patch to work similarly to the new way plocks will work in 2.8.9.  The FS acquires the VFS flock from its code.

	Helper scripts for "gfs_tool lockdump".

2004-08-26  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- use indexing rather than ccs list handling to retrieve node names   That way fence_init will not fail in the single node case.

2004-08-26  Adam Manthei  <amanthei@redhat.com>

	I forgot to add Lazar Obradovic's fencing agents to the bin Makefile. Thanks go to anton@hq.310.ru for pointing that out.

2004-08-26  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	So /that's/ why it was up there...

	A couple of endian fixes. mixed-endian clusters now seem to pass a cursory test.

	Don't send HELLO as soon as the kthread is started as that might b e too early.

	Fix stupid cut & paste bug with IPV6 multicast.

2004-08-25  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Unbreak gulm.

2004-08-25  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Get rid of some debugging info that is no longer relevant (or even compiles). Also fix some that is.

	pack the comms structures. They are already well-aligned but the compiler does exceed its orders slightly in this case.

	use REPLYEXP for ISLISTENING messages

2004-08-25  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	change the order in which we set up join/leave values so another thread can't see the SEVENT flag set before the pointer is set.

2004-08-24  Adam Manthei  <amanthei@redhat.com>

	Fencing agents contributed by Lazar Obradovic <laza@yu.net> for    o Qlogic SAN Box2    o IBM Blade Center (requires SNMP support.  Can be used instead of                        the xcat fencing agent)

2004-08-24  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Be a little less ACK-happy during transition. ACKs can now be embedded in data messages so, where we know there will be a reply there is no need for a separate ACK.

	Run dlm_recoverd only when we need to do recovery.

	Return the lockid to userland as soon as we know it.

2004-08-24  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	patches for 2.6.8.1

	use kthread routines to start/stop ast thread

2004-08-23  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Update to 2.6.8.1.

2004-08-23  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Use seq_file for /proc/cluster/services so we don't crash the kernel if there are more than a few lockspaces/GFS mounts etc.

	Setting a bad example...

2004-08-23  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Use a recovery daemon per lockspace.  This avoids deadlock when nodes recover multiple lockspaces in different orders.

2004-08-23  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Update libdlm doc.

2004-08-20  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Also include the pid in LKB rebuild

	Add PID to a lock which can be returned using the Query API.
	Thanks to Jeff Orlin for most of this code.

2004-08-19  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- forgot to remove eattr from the Makefile

2004-08-19  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Tidy LVB handling

2004-08-19  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	a couple error messages

2004-08-18  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Change AF_ number to 30 so it doesn't conflict with bluetooth. TIPC also uses this number and you're unlikely to be using both together.

	Create /dev/misc with reasonable permissions.

	Don't hang lkbs off the ownerqueue list as we don't have any control over their lifetime. Now that LKBs are destroyed before the ASTs are run this causes real problems.
	The ownerqueue is now strung through the lock_info structs themselves
	and we free those up when we can see that the lkb has been removed
	by the DLM core.

	This (for me) fixes Lon's SMP oops and also the dlmlock hang/oops
	mentioned in bugzilla #130148

2004-08-18  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	if the first start is cancelled by a stop before finishing, reset the last_start value (same as with dlm and fence services) and discard nodes saved from initial invalidated start.

	Use a separate DELAY_RECOVERY flag to postpone join/leave processing during recovery.  This leaves the DELAY flag used only for retries when joins/leaves conflict.  The interference between recoveries and delayed join/leave processing could lead to stalled recovery or a timer oops.

	some spacing cleanup

2004-08-17  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	Forgot to update kernel stuff.

2004-08-17  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix userspace LVBs (thanks, Jeff) Fix assert when creating sublocks - if we get asked to create a sublock on a master node then that's quite correct.

	Remove duplicate check.

2004-08-16  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	updated Makefile so that it make distclean works

	Oops. Forgot to update the man pages.

2004-08-14  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	Bunch of gnbd fixes.  The big one is that gnbd_monitor works like it's supposed to... Or at least if it doesn't, it's a bug, as opposed to just not being done. Most of the changes are under the covers, so accept for a more verbose gnbd_monitor list, all the UIs are the same.

	use the force=2 option for dlm_release_lockspace() to disregard any existing locks

	remove assertion that's not correct when multiple lock requests are in progress on the same resource at once (e.g. plocks from lock_dlm).

	moved to man dir

	install man dir

	move cman_tool.8 into man dir, add Makefile to install

	man page for cluster.conf

2004-08-12  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Remove crc32.c & build req. on it.

2004-08-12  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- move some stuff around. - fix brokenness when update occur simultaneously - more error checking

2004-08-12  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Don't update the bastaddr/param for a convert until the conversion has actually completed.. Patch from Jeff Orlin.
	Don't remove convert cancels from the list of locks owned by this process.

2004-08-12  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	previous fix incomplete, one other copy to zero

	when a recovery interrupts first start, the last_start value needs to be reset to 0 too to avoid assertion failure

	copy the current config_version into the cl_version struct in GET_VERSION.

	"cman_tool version -r <config>" can be used to update the config version of all cluster members.

	more refining of whether we deliver or skip bast delivery

2004-08-11  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	I think it would be a really nice idea to actually pass the flags into the kernel, rather than ignoring them, don't you ?

	If the dlm_unlock() call fails, the put the lock back on the ownerqueue so it gets unlocked wen the device is closed.

	Don't grant locks that have are waiting for unlock.

	Don't deliver blocking ASTs to locks that are in progress.

2004-08-11  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	- rebuild_freemem() was being called too early - the grantqueue must be checked for NOREBUILD locks when deciding   if an rsb should be remastered

	better format for lock dump on assert

	change flag name to reflect expanded use

	basts don't apply to the "plock update" lock, so don't provide a bast function.  also use the delete_lp routine to free it.

2004-08-10  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	link to the pthread library because magma needs it now.

2004-08-10  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Don't cleanr li_flags after setting the FIRSTLOCK bit

	Put some locking around the lockspace list. Tidy up how the user_ls gets freed.

	Fix a couple of error paths so they set errno.

	Use re-entrant gethostbyname2_r as we are juggling two hostent structures at the same time when starting multicast. previously the multicast address overwrite the local address as gethostbyname uses a static buffer.

	reinstate copy of lock name that got lost in the last change.

2004-08-10  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Make sure plock lp is off all lists before deleting, doesn't appear to fix bug, though.  Only allow one lock_dlm thread to do process recoveries when they pile up.

2004-08-10  Adam Manthei  <amanthei@redhat.com>

	fix a regex that ernoeously allowed the agent to access devices it shouldn't when using non admin users (see bug #129521)

	Fix for bug #129521
	o modifies regex's so that non-admin accounts can navigate the menus
	o better invalid user/passwd detection

2004-08-09  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Fix mutex deadlocks around cluster lock/unlock calls

2004-08-09  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Return error if we can't start all the listening sockets.

	Set return code if we can't leave the cluster.

	Userspace side of last checkin - sync routines for locking.
	Make sure this new library is only installed when you have the matching kernel
	changes available too.

	The "lets get all the API changes done in one day" checkin. Add Jeff (sorry, I've forgotten your last name)'s sync API call for userspace along with a separate  astarg for blocking ASTs

	Use new ioctl interface to start the cluster.

	Replaced setsockopts with ioctls.

2004-08-06  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Make ccsd give element name back with relevant cdata

2004-08-06  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	plain make in cluster dir doesn't work, but make install should

2004-08-05  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Remove old message encapsulation pieces and dependency on crc32.c

2004-08-05  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- take a stab at the cluster.conf.5 man page

	- incorrect synopsis

	- ccs is located in 7 not 8

	ccs is located in 7, not 8

2004-08-05  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	When granting locks, ignore locks on the wait queue that are also on the lockqueue.

	remove another assert

	A bunch of fixes related to dir lookup's, EEXIST errors from lookups, EINVAL errors from requests.  Most prevalent when doing lots of flocks or plocks.

2004-08-05  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- misc prog for magma.

2004-08-04  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- the sm plugin for magma seems to emit CE_NULL instead of CE_MEMB_CHANGE   when a node leaves or joins...  Therefore, we must reread the membership   list even when receiving CE_NULL.

	- allow ccs to reload config file if the node is quorate (covers the   case were ccs needs a restart)
	- return EINVAL if a cluster name is specified that is different than
	  the one that is loaded.

2004-08-04  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	try to clear up the build steps

2004-08-04  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Example init script for cman/dlm/fence/clvm

	Change the initialisation order, so if we get into the kernel twice by some strange behaviour, the error is less alarming.

2004-08-03  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	Removed the dependency on "all" from the "uninstall" target

2004-08-03  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- add cmd to remove old libs that were located in /lib (as part of the   uninstall target)

2004-08-03  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- this is the opteron stack bug fix here too.   don't think any one has seen it on this code. but it hurts nothing to   just put the fix in right away.

2004-08-03  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Always copy ast bits, even on convert (kernel vesion).

	Always copy AST parameters, even for converts.

	Remove some redundant code. sockaddr_cl no longer contains anything that kcl_get_node_by_addr can use.

2004-08-03  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	- when processing a combined delete and completion ast, do the deletion   first.  This avoids the next request coming and and finding the rsb   between the ast and the release_rsb which can lead to other problems. - return -EEXIST from a dir lookup when the node looking up the res   is already the master.  A request needs to be processed differently   when this happens. There are larger problems related to both of these, but these changes are legitimate even after the bigger changes that will make them less important.  For now, this should allow some tests to run successfully or at least better.

2004-07-30  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Do the parameter overrides correctly. Thanks for spotting that, Jeff!

2004-07-29  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	update from src files

2004-07-28  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	The lock counter used for DROPLOCKS callback wasn't accurate.  It now tracks the "locks held" value reported by gfs_tool counters.  These callbacks don't keep a lid on the number of locks but slows the growth anyway.  They now operate above 10,000 locks, delivered once a minute.

	Send a DROPLOCKS callback to gfs once every minute while the number of outstanding local locks is over 20,000.  Doesn't appear to be too effective but it might be in some cases.

	retry calls to ccs_connect if they return an error

2004-07-27  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- specifying a cluster name is only valid when the force command is used.

2004-07-27  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Cleanup of useless variable

2004-07-27  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	print the actual error value ccs returns

2004-07-27  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- must zero out rset variable before populating.

2004-07-26  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- when cman shuts down (as when cman_tool leave happens) close the connection   and attempt to reinitiate connection.
	This may be what is causing rbz128571.

	- multicast option is not ready yet.  Fail if it is specified.

	- add some man pages

2004-07-26  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Add locking around ls_requestqueue as it's accessed by both dlm_recoverd and dlm_recvd.

	tidy DLM_ASSERT statements

	Do reference counting on lockspace structs.  Looping mount/umount operations on multiple nodes would quickly result in a ls struct being freed while dlm_recoverd was still finishing a previous recovery on it.

2004-07-26  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Clear the "cluster_is_quorate" flag at shutdown

2004-07-23  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- sometimes getsockopt would report that bcast was enabled when it wasn't.   Since it doesn't hurt to set the flag regardless, we now set the bcast   flag w/o checking to see if it is enabled already.

2004-07-23  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	die if we cannot talk with ccs when starting up

2004-07-23  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix race on islistening queries.

	Pass the unqualified name into the kernel, so the cluster node name never has domain names attached to it.

2004-07-23  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	- clvmd_fix_conf.sh usage was wrong - add info about building modules outside kernel tree - cluster.xml has changed to cluster.conf

	When a request completion is received in lock_dlm during recovery, the lock must be demoted to NL and rerequested in the originally requested mode after recovery completes (only NOEXP requests can be completed for gfs during recovery.)
	When a lock was rerequested, the QUECVT flag was always being set even
	though the lock may also have the EXPEDITE (gfs's PRIORITY) flag set.
	It's illegal to use EXPEDITE and QUECVT together, so we now only set
	QUECVT if EXPEDITE isn't.  An assertion fails if both flags are used.

	remove a printk that can be annoying

	fenced was not correctly matching fqdn's from cman and basic hostnames from ccs

2004-07-22  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- decent start of documenting cmdline args and config file for gulm.   still needs some work.

	- gulm will now get its configs from ccsd.   I'll be adjusting man pages next so syntax will be there.

2004-07-22  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- update configure scripts to set %{libdir} to /usr/lib
	- make ccs use magma and magmamsg
	- change from using /etc/cluster/cluster.xml to /etc/cluster/cluster.conf

	- put in a forgotten unlock in an error condition in magma

2004-07-22  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Get rid of zero-initialisers as the compiler (or is it the linker? I always forget) does this for us.
	Include the quorate state in HELLO messages.

2004-07-22  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	update from src files

	- Improve/fix the way we lock the rootres list.  The two rwsem's we   were using still weren't sufficient for cases where release_rsb was   called while traversing the root list.  Replace the two sems with   one new "ls_root_lock".  I hope this fixes the rootres list corruption   I was seeing.  It's much saner locking in any case.
	- Add some log_debug() statements for cases where dlm_unlock() returns
	  an EINVAL error so we can figure out what went wrong if the lock_dlm
	  assert fails.

	- Have next_move() detect the case where a first start on the ls is
	  interrupted by a recovery event.  I expect this will fix the related
	  assert failure that was reported, although I've can't reproduce to
	  confirm.

	on assert failure dump dlm's debug buffer

	An unlock request is waiting for a reply from a master node.  That master node fails causing a recovery event.  As of yesterday we simply treat these unlock requests as completed and don't rebuild them during recovery.  Before queueing the completion ast for these unlock requests the lkb must be removed from the rsb queue and the lockqueue.  An assertion failure was caused by not doing this.

	add BUG() to assertion

	initialize cluster_is_quorate to 0

2004-07-21  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	update from src files

2004-07-21  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	neaten up some bits by calling send_kill() rather than building up our own KILL message.

2004-07-21  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	if remote_stage2() gets a request, it should return EINVAL if: - no rsb exists for the named resource - the rsb exists but the nodeid is -1 - the rsb exists with some remote master specified The last case wasn't recognized and was causing an assertion failure. (The last two cases together are equivalent to res_nodeid != 0.)

2004-07-21  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	A couple of endian fixes.

2004-07-21  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	In-progress unlock requests interrupted by a recovery event weren't always handled correctly.  I also no longer get failed dir removals during recovery.

2004-07-20  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- reshaped the way i was building the lock key names.  This new method   avoids a limit of 8 bytes for node names.

	- CFLAGS in make/defines.mk is ignored if you don't use += in the Makefiles

2004-07-20  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Distinguish between not being able to get the cluster ACTIVE state, and the cluster actually being active.

2004-07-20  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Suiddir support suggested by anton@hq.310.ru.

2004-07-20  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Tidy up temp nodeids after a transition.

2004-07-20  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	tidy a bit of code that decides if a new master should be looked up. makes it easier to experiment with new code in this area.

	if deserialise_lkb finds the lkb already exists, advance the pointer so we can correctly read the next item and print a debug message so we know if this is actually happening.

	pass the dlm_header into add_to_requestqueue so we can print the cmd

	recycle dir entries when rebuilding res directory instead of freeing and immediately reallocating thousands of them.

2004-07-20  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Don't clear the temp_nodeid until we've /really/ finished with it. should finally nail #126526

	Fix race where two reads/accepts could arrive in quick sucession but only the first would be serviced. This fix does both reads AND accepts as opposed to the last one which only did reads.
	I reckon this should fix bug #126758

2004-07-20  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	print rsb in remote_stage2 assertion

2004-07-20  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- remember to closedir()

2004-07-19  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Install man page

	Man page for cman_tool

	Print error if no nodeIDs are passed to "cman_tool kill"

	Tidy up accept path a bit.

2004-07-17  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	Reordered munging of modes on inode create.

2004-07-16  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	update from src files

	- the new MASTER rsb flag wasn't being set during recovery when   an rsb from a departed node was remastered; this prevented the   dir entry for the rsb from eventually being removed which made   all further requests on that rsb invalid
	- take dirtbl lock when clearing dir during recovery even though
	  it's not strictly necessary

	- save dir nodeid in release_rsb instead of calculating it twice

2004-07-16  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	If there's anything left to read after recvmsg, then make sure we get it.

	oops, remove annoying (and badly formatted) debug prints

	Validate nodeIDs

2004-07-16  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	dlm_unlock_stage2: copy new lvb from lkb before granting new locks to ensure they get the latest copy.

	Three different problems resulting from recent change to quit doing a convert-to-NL on a gfs unlock: - dlm_unlock wasn't passing VALBLK flag to write lvb on unlock - wake/complete for synchronous (internal) unlocks rather than gfs callback - lm_hold_lvb() wasn't preserving lvb contents since a dlm_unlock would   free the lkb and rsb.  Now if there's an lvb to preserve, convert to NL   on a lm_unlock() and do dlm_unlock on lm_unhold_lvb().

2004-07-15  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix some small odd bugs in startup conditions: - when taking over as master, make sure we always get a nodeid for the new node   in a NEWNODE transition - Fix some potential oopses in error messages - Allow a JOINACK_NAK message to come after a JOINACK_ACK in case the ACKing   node has to back down as master.

2004-07-15  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Fix breakage in SM plugin when querying group membership w/o logging in; install in /usr

2004-07-15  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	the recently changed version of release_rsb() checks the new RESFL_MASTER flag to decide if a dir_remove is necessary.  rsb's remastered during recovery weren't having this flag set.

	get rid of the _recovery version of dir_lookup which only related to sequence numbers

	remove "resdata" from function names since we've renamed things

	- /proc/cluster/dlm_dir to dump resource directory - change 5s constant for recovery wait timer into config.recover_timer - simplify logic that decides if dir removal is needed - add more detail to some log_debug statements - a call to release_rsb() was missing in remote_stage2 after successful   lookup of rsb with nodeid of -1 (where einval is returned) - change log_debug to log_all in dir removal errors which should now   be very uncommon (if they occur at all) - add a call to schedule between an einval reply and a repeat dir lookup

2004-07-15  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- couple changes to make files

2004-07-14  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Clean up the temp nodeIDs list at shutdown.

2004-07-14  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	- change in the way name_to_directory_nodeid works.  get rid of the bitmask   step and just do a modulus on the hash value.  the bitmask introduced an   imbalance with some node counts that could cause a more heavily weighted   node to be more prone to run out of memory (esp during recovery.)
	- change the way we handle the case where a granted message arrives before
	  the reply to the original request.  take the request out of the queue
	  right away and assign the remote lkid instead of waiting for the delayed
	  reply.  this is a rare circumstance but removes potential for problems.

2004-07-13  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- add targets to the make file for updating subtrees to latest tags.

2004-07-13  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	update from src files

2004-07-13  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Missed a couple of files from the last tidying commit

	Remove resdir sequence number from all structs as it's no longer used.

2004-07-13  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	Change the way lm_dlm_unlock() works.  We previously demoted to NL on a lm unlock and then did a dlm_unlock() on the lm put_lock.  Now do a full dlm_unlock() for each lm unlock.  This avoids some odd problems in some gfs tests.  We can reintroduce a convert-to-NL optimization later on if need be.

2004-07-13  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix an obscure but potentially nasty race on the resource directory.

2004-07-12  Ken Preslan  <kpreslan@redhat.com>

	mess with tabs (unaligned in cvsweb...)

	remove stray printk

	Naming changes.  Get rid of struct typedefs and gd_ prefix.  Improve some of the structure names.  Use consistent hash table method for rsb/lkb/dir lists.

2004-07-09  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	Fixed some login structure size issues, so that gnbd clients and servers can be different architectures. 32 bit servers can now have 64 bit clients, etc. Also cleaned up code to get rid of compile warnings on 64 bit machies.

2004-07-09  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- fixes bug #126970   ifelseifelseifelse doesn't work without the elses.

2004-07-09  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	a recent checkin incorrectly switched unlock_stage2 to reference an lkb after it was potentially freed.

	- set lkb nodeid to -1 when it's created.  this prevents an assert during   recovery on an lkb for which the rsb master is being looked up   (recent shift in assigning lkb nodeid exposed this) - add print_lkb/print_rsb to some existing asserts

	in dlm_lock_stage1 set lkb nodeid to the rsb's nodeid only after the rsb is certain to have the correct nodeid itself.

	- in unlock get the rsb after holding the in_recovery lock otherwise an   in-progress request is not redirected after recovery - add an assert

	pjc found spot where lock struct wasn't being freed

2004-07-09  Adam Manthei  <amanthei@redhat.com>

	o added support for APC 79XX

	o whitespace cleanup

2004-07-08  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Stop users calling dlm_[ls_]_pthread_init() more than once. Reset fd flags on return from dlm_dispatch().

	Add timeout feature for resdir entries so they don't go away as soon as the last lock is dequeued. You can configure the time using a config entry, set this to zero to get the old behaviour

2004-07-07  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Fix assertion.

2004-07-07  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	loosen assertion to allow us to send an rsb lookup to ourselves this can legitimately happen during recovery by resend_cluster_requests

	update from src files

	- when an assertion fails dump all rsb's and lkb's to console

	- when a dlm_unlock() removes the last lkb from an rsb, reset the   master nodeid in the rsb to -1 to force a subsequent dlm_lock() to   look up the potentially new master.  Add find_rsb_to_unlock() for this   which holds a lock to make the test and set atomic wrt new dlm_lock()'s. - lots of assertions added - lots of log_debug()'s added (/proc/cluster/dlm_debug)

2004-07-06  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	remove and clean up some debugging

	- Patrick's fix to set rsb nodeid to -1 during unlock crept into a   previous checkin. - Modify release_rsb() to cope with -1 nodeids and properly remove   resource directory entries.

2004-07-05  Patrick Caulfield  <pcaulfie@redhat.com>

	Tidy atomic decrement.

	Add support for more VMS-like locking mode where new locks will not be granted if there are already locks waiting for conversion.
	This is enabled per lockspace and is OFF by default.

	Fix a couple of 64bit compiler warnings.

	Add in more architectures. Note: this is /not/ a list of supported architectures, in fact very few other than i386 have been tested (and then not for some time). But fixes for other architectures are welcomed.

	minor changes to resource directory lookups. - increment rd entry's seq number safely by holding the rd lock - don't pass rd structs to callers since there's no reference counting   on them; just return the nodeid and seq values instead.  safer and   cleaner approach. - add debugging code which will be reduced when current problems are   sorted out (strname used for debug prints will be removed)

2004-07-03  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	Fixed some annoying bugs.  Previously, when you unimported a gnbd (with gnbd_import -R or -r) you could try to kill a gnbd_recvd process that was already dead.. This would result in you killing the pid -1, and bad things happening.
	Also, gnbd_monitor wasn't accepting connections, which was causing commands
	to hang. This problem was introduced in fixing an earlier bug.

	Both these issues are fixed.

2004-07-02  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	Changed the /dev/gnbd_ctl node I make from major 11 to major 10, which is what misc devices are. I don't know why I haven't seen any issues with this until now.... As far as I can tell, gnbd_import shouldn't have been working at all. If anyone has been seeing
	gnbd_recvd[8311]: ERROR [gnbd_recvd.c:190] cannot open gnbd control device : No such device or address

	messages, they should go away now.

	Bring patch uptodate with the sources.

2004-06-29  Jonathan Brassow  <jbrassow@redhat.com>

	- change log code to not print log_msg if verbose is not set. - fix problem where ccsd exits if cman_tool leave is performed.
	If a cman_tool leave occurs, ccsd will drop into non-quorate mode -
	disallowing connections unless they are forced - which should only
	be done by cluster managers.

2004-06-29  Lon Hohberger  <lhh@redhat.com>

	Make dumb driver act like there's a real, one-node cluster.

2004-06-29  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	missing "_" in gnbd_monitor... caused gnbd_import to fail with uncached devices

	devfs was set to use /dev/gnbd/<minor>, but gnbd_import sets the gnbds cluster unique name in /dev/gnbd/<name>.. This was causing problems for devfs users. The devfs links for gnbd devices will now be in /dev/gnbd_minor/<minor> These should never be used, since this device name is not consistent across the cluster.

2004-06-29  David Teigland  <teigland@redhat.com>

	update from src files

	Fix the way we do lkb deletions.  The DELAST flag is removed and a delete arg is passed to queue_ast() when the lkb should be deleted following the ast delivery.  In the past, setting the the DELAST flag on an lkb could result in it being detected by an in-progress deliver_ast() and the lkb being deleted early.  I'm hopeful this was the cause of the oopses we'd see in process_asts().

	include lockspace.h

2004-06-28  Benjamin Marzinski  <bmarzins@redhat.com>

	fixed obvious error.. If the gnbd_ctl device wasn't present, I was trying to remove it, causing:
	gnbd_import: ERROR cannot remove /dev/gnbd_ctl : No such file or directory

2004-06-28  Michael Conrad Tadpol Tilstra  <mtilstra@redhat.com>

	- this is the idea I have for having gulm use ccs.  This code here   compiles, but has not been tested.  Further, gulm will not use ccs,   unless you compile with -DREADYFORCCS   I am a little leary about some of the string fiddling I did, which is why   I want to test it first.  But being that I'm going on vacation soon, I   wanted to leave you all with this code.  Feel free to play, but do no be   suprised by bugs. - fiddled with the symbols exported by libgulm.

2004-06-28  Adam Manthei  <amanthei@redhat.com>

	Addresses an issue that was seen w/ the APC Masterswitch.  logins can fail if the APC is logged into too fast.  This update does two things to reduce the likelihood of this bug:
	1. It trys to logout cleanly instead of just closing the telnet connection
	2. retrys twice upon login failure.

	There is a bug in the APC that will cause it to reset itself from time to
	time.  There doesn't appear to be anything that we can do about that though.

	Thanks (and blame! :) go to Erling for helping resolve the issue.

	The GNBD clients and servers now distinguish eachother via nodename, instead of IP.  This was keeping gnbd from working smoothly with gulm on machines with one ip interface for lock traffic and one for block traffic. Also it removes some ipv4 to ipv6 headaches.  The clients now connect to the server via ipv4 or ipv6.. ipv6 prefferentially.  You can force a connection from the client to the sever to go over a specific path by using the ip address instead of the hostname. A bunch of code cleaning.. removing duplicated functions and such. Two related issues that still need to be done.. The server only accepts ipv4 connections now, but this is trivial to fix, and fence_gnbd needs a parameter switch, from ipaddr to nodename.  These will get checked in shortly.
